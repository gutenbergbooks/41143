<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The naming of our highways is an
interesting study. Like roads the
world over they are usually known
by two names&mdash;the destinations to which
they lead. The famous highway through
New York state is known as the Genesee
Road in the eastern half of the state and as
the Albany Road in the western portion.
In a number of cities through which it
passes&mdash;Utica, Syracuse, etc.&mdash;it is Genesee
Street. This path in the olden time
was the great road to the famed Genesee
country. The old Forbes Road across
Pennsylvania soon lost its earliest name;
but it is preserved at its termination, for the
Pittsburger of today goes to the Carnegie
Library on the &ldquo;Forbes Street&rdquo; car line.
The Maysville Pike&mdash;as unknown today
as it was of national prominence three
quarters of a century ago&mdash;leading across
Ohio from Wheeling to Maysville (Lime<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>stone)
and on to Lexington, is known in
Kentucky as the Zanesville Pike; from that
city in Ohio the road branched off from the
old National Road. The &ldquo;Glade Road&rdquo;
was the important branch of the Pennsylvania
or Pittsburg Road which led through
the Glades of the Alleghenies to the
Youghiogheny. One of the most singular
names for a road was that of the &ldquo;Shun
Pike&rdquo; between Watertown and Erie, in
northwestern Pennsylvania. The large
traffic over the old &ldquo;French Road&rdquo;&mdash;Marin&rsquo;s
Portage Road&mdash;between these
points on Lake Erie and French Creek
necessitated, early in the nineteenth century,
a good road-bed. Accordingly a road
company took hold of the route and
improved it&mdash;placing toll gates on it for
recompensation. Those who refused to
pay toll broke open a parallel route nearby,
which was as free as it was rough. It became
known as the &ldquo;Shun&rdquo; Pike because
those who traversed it shunned the toll road.</p>

<p>Few roads named from their builders,
such as Braddock, Forbes, Bouquet, Wayne,
Ebenezer Zane, Marin, and Boone preserved
the oldtime name. Indeed nearly all our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
roads have lost the ancient name, a fact
that should be sincerely mourned. The
Black Swamp has been drained, therefore
there can be now no &ldquo;Black Swamp
Road.&rdquo; There are now no refugees and
the &ldquo;Refugees Road&rdquo; is lost not only to
sight but to the memory of most. Perhaps
there is but one road in the central West
which is commonly known and called by
the old Indian name; this is the &ldquo;Tuscarawas
Path,&rdquo; a modern highway in Eastern
Ohio which was widened and made a white
man&rsquo;s road by the first white army that
ever crossed the Ohio River into what is
now the State of Ohio.</p>

<p>One roadway&mdash;the Wilderness Road to
Kentucky from Virginia and Tennessee,
the longest, blackest, hardest road of
pioneer days in America&mdash;holds the oldtime
name with undiminished loyalty and is true
today to every gloomy description and vile
epithet that was ever written or spoken of
it. It was broken open for white man&rsquo;s use
by Daniel Boone from the Watauga settlement
on the Holston River, Tennessee, to
the mouth of Otter Creek on the Kentucky
River in the month preceding the outbreak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
of open revolution at Lexington and Concord.
It was known as &ldquo;Boone&rsquo;s Trail,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Kentucky Road,&rdquo; the &ldquo;road to Caintuck,&rdquo;
or the &ldquo;Virginia Road,&rdquo; but its
common name was the &ldquo;Wilderness
Road.&rdquo; A wilderness of laurel thickets
lay between the Kentucky settlements and
Cumberland Gap and was the most desolate
country imaginable. The name was transferred
to the road that passed through it.
It seems right that the brave frontiersman
who opened this route to white men should
be remembered by this act; and for a title
to this volume &ldquo;Boone&rsquo;s Wilderness Road&rdquo;
has been selected.</p>

<p>As in the case of other highways with
which this series of monographs is dealing,
so with Boone&rsquo;s Wilderness Road: the road
itself is of little consequence. The following
pages treat of phases of the story of the
West suggested by Boone&rsquo;s Road&mdash;the
first social movement into the lower Ohio
Valley, Henderson&rsquo;s Transylvania Company,
the struggle of the Watauga settlement
to prevent the southern Indians from
cutting Kentucky off from the world, the
struggle of the Kentucky settlements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
against the British and their Indian allies,
the burst of population over Boone&rsquo;s Road
into Kentucky, and what the early founding
of that commonwealth meant to the East
and to the West.</p>

<p>Boone and Harrod and their compatriots
assured the world of the splendid lands of
Kentucky; Richard Henderson and his
associates of the Transylvania Company
proved the questionable fact that a settlement
there could be made and be maintained.
Boone&rsquo;s Road, opened for the
Transylvania Company, made a way thither.
The result was a marvelous westward
movement that for timeliness, heroism and
ultimate success is without a parallel in our
annals. When the armies of the Revolutionary
War are counted, that first army of
twenty-five thousand men, women, and
children which hurried over Boone&rsquo;s little
path, through dark Powell&rsquo;s Valley, over the
&ldquo;high-swung gateway&rdquo; of Cumberland
Gap, and down through the laurel wildernesses
to Crab Orchard, Danville, Lexington,
and Louisville must not be forgotten.
No army ever meant so much to the West;
some did not mean more to the East.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE PILGRIMS OF THE WEST</h3>

<p>No English colony in America looked
upon the central West with such
jealous eye as Virginia. The beautiful
valley of the <i>Oyo</i>&mdash;the Indian
exclamation for &ldquo;Beautiful&rdquo;&mdash;which ran
southwesterly through the great forests of
the continent&rsquo;s interior was early claimed
as the sole possession of the Virginians.
The other colonies were hemmed in by
prescribed boundary lines, definitely outlined
in their royal charters. New York
was bounded by Lake Erie and the Allegheny
and thought little of the West.
The Pennsylvanian colony was definitely
bounded by the line which is the western
boundary line of that commonwealth today.
Carolina&rsquo;s extremity stopped at thirty-six
degrees and thirty minutes. Virginia&rsquo;s
western boundary was not defined; hence
the West was hers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>England herself was not at all sure of the
West until after the fall of Quebec; but
the Treaty of Paris was soon signed and, so
far as the French were concerned, the
colonies extended to the Mississippi. Then
Pontiac&rsquo;s bloody war broke out and matters
were at a standstill until Bouquet hewed
his way into &ldquo;the heart of the enemies&rsquo;
country&rdquo; and, on the Muskingum, brought
Pontiac&rsquo;s desperate allies, the Delawares
and Shawanese, to terms.</p>

<p>But now, when the West was his, the
king of England did a wondrous thing.
He issued a proclamation in the year 1763
which forbade anyone securing &ldquo;patents
for any lands beyond the heads or sources
of any of the rivers which fall into the
Atlantic Ocean from the West or Northwest!&rdquo;
Thus Lord Hillsborough, British
Secretary for the Colonies, thought to
checkmate what he called the &ldquo;roving
disposition&rdquo; of the colonists, particularly
the Virginians. The other colonies were
restrained by definite boundaries; Virginia,
too, should be restrained.</p>

<p>Hillsborough might as well have adopted
the plan of the ignoramus who, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
methods for keeping the Indians from
crossing the frontier were being discussed,
suggested that a strip of land along the
entire western frontier be cleared of trees
and bushes, in the belief that the savages
would not dare to cross the open! Yet the
secretary&rsquo;s agent set to work to mark out a
western boundary line which should connect
the western lines of Georgia and New
York and so accomplish the limitation of
Virginia.</p>

<p>But the Virginians also acted. They
sent an agent of their own, Thomas
Walker, to Fort Stanwix (Rome, New
York) to treat with the Six Nations for
some of this very western land that Hillsborough
was contriving to keep them out
of. For the king issued the proclamation
in the interest of the western Indians (and
the annuities he received when the fur
trade was prosperous) who desired that the
West should be preserved to them. But
what could be said if Virginia purchased
the Indian&rsquo;s claim? Could a king&rsquo;s proclamation
keep the Virginians from a territory
to which, for value received, the
Indians had given a quit-claim deed?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>This famous Treaty of Fort Stanwix was
held in the fall of 1768. Three thousand
Indians were present. Presents were
lavished upon the chieftains. The western
boundary line crossed from the west branch
of the Susquehanna to Kittanning on the
Allegheny River; it followed the Allegheny
and Ohio Rivers southwest to the mouth
of the Great Kanawha. Here it met Hillsborough&rsquo;s
line which came up from Florida
and which made the Great Kanawha the
western boundary of Virginia. Had the
Fort Stanwix line stopped here the western
boundary line of the colonies would have
been as Lord Hillsborough desired. But
Walker did not pause here. Sir William
Johnson, British Indian Agent for the
Northern District, who was &ldquo;thoroughly
versed in the methods of making profit by
his office,&rdquo; allowed Walker to extend the
line so as to enclose Virginia&rsquo;s prospective
purchase; and the Tennessee River was
made the western boundary instead of the
Great Kanawha. Thus Johnson at once satisfied
the claims of Virginia and the pride of
the Six Nations, who were still anxious to
prove their long-boasted possession over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the Cumberland region, as well as their
sovereignty over the hated Cherokee, by
thus formally disposing of the land. So
everyone was satisfied&mdash;but Hillsborough.
And yet the Crown was compelled, finally,
to approve the Treaty of Fort Stanwix.</p>

<p>This treaty marks an epoch in the history
of the central West, since, thereby, nearly
half of it became a portion of one of the
Thirteen Colonies. The other half, north
of the Ohio River, remained in the possession
of the Indians who inhabited it.</p>

<p>It is remarkable how little known that
great territory was which now became a
part of Virginia. This was largely because
it was an uninhabited country. The territory
north of the Ohio River was filled
with Indian nations, some of whom had
reigned there from times prehistoric. This
was likewise true of the country south,
where the great southern confederacies had
held sway since white men came to this
continent. But between these inhabited
areas lay a pleasant land which any tribe
would have gladly possessed had there not
been so many rivals for it. Consequently
it became a &ldquo;dark and bloody&rdquo; land where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
a thousand unrecorded battles were fought
by Indians from both North and South who
had the temerity to come there to hunt, or
by armies who were hurrying through it
in search of their foes who lived beyond.
No Bouquet had pierced through to the
Cumberland to release prisoners who might
bring back reports of the land. No missionaries
had carried their &ldquo;great and
good&rdquo; words to this battle ground of the
Nations and returned with tidings of its
splendid meadows and their fertility. One
or two adventuresome explorers had looked
there and brought back practically all
that the world knew of it. But they had
never visited the most pleasant portions
and knew little, if anything, of its real
value. And all the Indians seemed to
know was that it was a bloody border-land
where no tribe could hunt in peace; where
every shadow contained a lurking foe; and
where every inch of soil was drenched with
blood.</p>

<p>Thus to an unknown and unoccupied
border-land between the Indians of the
North and those to the South, Virginia
obtained, from one of its alleged possessors,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
a nominal hold. Could she maintain it?
The world asked the question and awaited
the answer, wonderingly.</p>

<p>The principal reason why Virginia was
successful was because her inhabitants
were an agricultural people like their ancestors
before them in England.  Being an
agricultural people they had expanded
further, geographically, than the inhabitants
of any of the other colonies. As
early as 1740, cabins were being built in
Bedford County, Virginia, over one hundred
and fifty miles from the seaboard. There
were settlements on the New River, a
branch of the Great Kanawha, before the
French and Indian war. Fort Loudoun,
over the border, was erected in 1756, and
Forts Long Island and Chissel in 1758.
The Wyoming massacre in New York State
in the Revolutionary War occurred on what
was then the frontier, though Wyoming
was less than a hundred miles from New
York City. And, fortunately, this agricultural
people was located in the most favorable
place along the Atlantic for expansion,
for a reason already mentioned. Back of
New York and Pennsylvania roamed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Iroquois, Delawares, Shawanese, and other
Indian nations. Back of Virginia, whose
fine rivers rose in the mountains, lay a
comparatively uninhabited country; for,
the moment the Indians became allied
with either of the encroaching European
powers, they ceased contending together
in the border-land behind Virginia. It
was not until Virginians began to occupy
it that it became anew a &ldquo;dark and bloody
ground.&rdquo; Virginia knew less of Indian
warfare than some of the neighboring colonies
until the era of her expansion
when her sturdy people began occupying
the land obtained at the Treaty of Fort
Stanwix.</p>

<p>The expansion of Virginia was greatly
facilitated by the geographical position of
the mountains along her western frontier.
While the mountains of western New York
and Pennsylvania obstructed expansion, in
Virginia the mountain ranges facilitated it.
Further north they trended directly north
and south and even the rivers could find a
passage-way only by following the most
tortuous courses. True, the Hudson and
Mohawk valleys offered a clear course to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the great highland across to the Niagara
River, but it was not until very late in the
eighteenth century that the path across
this watershed was open to white men.
The two routes through Pennsylvania
crossed the mountains horizontally and
almost feared to follow the waterways.
Braddock&rsquo;s Road crossed the waters of one
stream three times at right angles in the
space of eighty miles and did not follow it
one hundred yards altogether. In Virginia
the mountain ranges trend southwesterly,
with the rivers between them, offering a
practicable though roundabout route westward.</p>

<p>But there was another thing Virginia
possessed in addition to an agricultural
people&mdash;an uninhabited territory west of
her and some plain courses into it. She
had among her citizens some daring, far-sighted,
energetic men who might easily
be called the first promoters of America.
They were moneyed men who sought
honestly to make money; but they were
also men of chivalry and intense patriotism&mdash;Virginians
of Virginians. They
thought of their pockets, but they also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
thought of their colony and their king;
the standing of the Old Dominion was very
dear to them: its growth in commercial as
well as geographical dimensions. They
desired to be thought well of at home; they
desired that Virginia should be thought
the best of all America.</p>

<p>Of these men the Washingtons were the
most prominent, and George Washington
was a marvelously inspired leader. As
early as 1749 Virginians secured a grant
of land south of the Ohio and directly west
of old Virginia. The enterprise amounted
to nothing save by precipitating the contest
between England and France for the West.
The example of the younger Washington
in fighting for the possession of the West,
in encouraging the disheartened people of
the frontier in the dark days of defeat, in
aiding in the final victory, in investing
heavily in western land (for he, it is said,
died the richest man in America, and half
his wealth lay west of the Alleghenies), in
encouraging the building of the Potomac
Canal, in impressing upon the people the
commercial value of exploiting the entire
West from Lake Huron to Cumberland<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Gap, affords perhaps the most remarkable
instance in our whole national history of
one man inspiring a people to greater
things. A place and a rough way thither
was ready for expanding Virginia&mdash;and
such sons as Washington gave the inspiration.</p>

<p>Through the great &ldquo;trough&rdquo; between
the Allegheny and Blue Ridge ranges
passes the pioneer route to which we of the
central West owe as much as to any thoroughfare
in America&mdash;that rough, long,
roundabout road which, coming down from
Lancaster and Yorktown, crossed the Potomac
at Wadkin&rsquo;s Ferry, and passed up the
Shenandoah valley by Martinsburg, Winchester
and Staunton; and on to the headwaters
of the New River, where it was
joined by the thoroughfare through central
Virginia from Richmond. Here, near the
meeting of these famous old-time Virginia
thoroughfares, stood Fort Chissel, erected
in 1758 and situated two hundred miles
east of Cumberland Gap. Beyond Fort
Chissel ran the Indian trail toward the Gap
and, within fifty miles of the Gap, stood
Fort Watauga on a branch of the Holston.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
This was the most westerly fort at the time
of the Stanwix treaty, and about the rude
fort was springing up the Watauga settlement.
Other earlier settlements were
made at Draper&rsquo;s Meadows and at Inglis
Ferry on New River by families bearing
those names. For more than a century the
population of Virginia and North Carolina
had been slowly sifting up the river valleys
toward the West and by the time the
king&rsquo;s proclamation was issued many cabins
were already erected beyond the headwaters
of streams which fell &ldquo;into the Atlantic
Ocean from the West or Northwest.&rdquo; Even
the faithful Hillsborough seems to have
recognized this since his boundary line
passed through Chiswell&rsquo;s Mine on the
Great Kanawha and the mouth of that
river&mdash;much further west than a strict
interpretation of the proclamation would
allow.</p>

<p>This vanguard which was moving westward
was led by explorers and hunters.
Of two of the former, mention will be particularly
made. The parties of hunters
who now began to press beyond the
furthest settlements, while they subsisted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
on game, were also real explorers of the
West and helped to set in motion and give
zest to the great immigration which followed
the signing of the Stanwix treaty.
It was only one year after the Stanwix
treaty when Daniel Boone came up from
his home on the Yadkin in North Carolina
and led a company of men through the
Gap into the land whose hero and idol he
was ever to be. About the same time John
Finley and party were trapping on the forbidden
rivers, and Colonel James Knox
and company of nine hunted on the New,
Clinch, and Holston Rivers, and reaching
even to the lower Cumberland in 1769-70.
These parties of men found that a paradise
for the husbandman was to be speedily
revealed to the world at the foothills of
the Cumberland and Pine mountains on the
great plain falling away westward to the
Mississippi. At first, only the most vague
description of the rich meadows of the
West reached the Virginian settlements,
but, meager as they were, they started a
tide of immigration quite unparalleled in
American history. One of these descriptions
is preserved for us in the autobiog<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>raphy
of Daniel Boone, and, though
couched in language with which he was
probably less familiar than his amanuensis,
still is not unlike the stories told in border
cabins to eager listening frontiersmen who
were soon on their rough way to this El
Dorado beyond the horrid ranges of the
Cumberlands:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We found everywhere abundance of
wild beasts of all sorts, through this vast
forest. The buffalo were more frequent
than I have seen cattle in the settlements,
browsing on the leaves of the cane, or
cropping the herbage on those extensive
plains, fearless, because ignorant of the
violence of man.... Nature was here a
series of wonders and a fund of delight.
Here she displayed her ingenuity and
industry in a variety of flowers and fruits,
beautifully colored, elegantly shaped and
charmingly flavored; and we were diverted
with innumerable animals presenting themselves
perpetually to our view.... Just
at the close of day the gentle gales retired
and left the place to the disposal of a profound
calm. Not a breeze shook the most
tremulous leaf. I had gained the summit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
of a commanding ridge, and, looking around
with astonishing delight, beheld the ample
plains, the beauteous tracts below: On the
other hand had I surveyed the famous
Ohio river, that rolled in silent dignity,
marking the western boundary of Kentucky
with inconceivable grandeur. At a vast
distance I beheld the mountains lift their
venerable brows, and penetrate the clouds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inspired by such descriptions as these,
there came in the wake of the hunter-explorers
crowds of immigrants. Very
many came even bringing their families,
for the novelty of the adventure and
because there was nothing to keep them
where they had had but a tomahawk claim
on the border. There were thousands who
entered the West and became valuable
citizens (considering the work to be done)
who would best be described as gypsies.
For a larger part of the way across the continent
this peculiar class of people moved
westward between the advanced explorers
and the swarm of genuine &ldquo;settlers&rdquo;
whose feet, even at this time, were making
the middle of our continent tremble. For
instance, very many of the first settlers in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the territory near the Mississippi hailed
from a portion of the land between their
home there and the Allegheny mountains,
just as many of the first settlers between
the Ohio and Lake Erie hailed from Virginia&rsquo;s
land between the Ohio and Tennessee.
The phrase &ldquo;following the
immigration&rdquo; was a common one and
covered this class of pioneers who moved
away from a given district of land when
it began to fill with settlers. There
has appeared a disposition in some quarters
to attempt to minimize the value
of the hosts of so-called &ldquo;squatters&rdquo; and
&ldquo;tomahawk claimers&rdquo; who first moved
into the West. Our pioneer literature is
full of discreditable allusions, made by the
second tide of pioneers who came West,
concerning the scattered ranks of first
comers, their moral character, their ways
of thought and living. The later blueblood
stock had not a little to say concerning
the pioneers of Western Virginia and
Kentucky flavored with the same spice that
Dickens employed when, a little later, he
jotted down his &ldquo;American Notes.&rdquo; It
seems as though it were reasonable to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
remember what these first comers did rather
than the picture of what they were. But
for them there could never have been a
better West. Who composed the armies
of McIntosh, Brodhead, Crawford, Harmar,
St. Clair, and Wayne but these rough, wild-looking
men who first entered the West?
What is now western Pennsylvania, West
Virginia, and Kentucky gave practically
all the troops which conquered the land
between the Ohio River and the Great
Lakes. And all of them, save the few who
could raise money to buy some of it, retired
again to their slovenly &ldquo;claims&rdquo; south of
the Ohio&mdash;and a flood-tide of newcomers
came after them to bring a new era they
could never have brought, and, incidentally,
leave to posterity repulsive pictures
of them. It hath been said: &ldquo;Instead of
the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and
instead of the brier shall come up the
myrtle tree; and it shall be to the Lord for
a name, for an everlasting sign that shall
not be cut off.&rdquo; The West was a land of
brier and thorn, and men as rough as briers
and thorns were needed to strike the first
swift hard blows. The squatter in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
West played an important part and should
not be remembered solely by the pictures
drawn of his filth, lawlessness, and laziness.
The Cleaveland of 1798 was a paradise
beside the Cleveland of 1810. Was it not
Caleb Atwater who said that &ldquo;not one
young man, whose family was rich, and of
very high standing in the Eastern States,
has succeeded in Ohio?&rdquo; A little later
in this narrative we shall read of one
&ldquo;Abraham hanks&rdquo; who went, an unknown
pioneer, with Daniel Boone
through Cumberland Gap at the very
van of all the western immigration!
Atwater was not referring to his grandson&mdash;the
immortal son of Nancy Hanks.
Theodore Roosevelt in the following words
has emphasized the debt our country owes
to this class of early citizens: &ldquo;Nevertheless
this very ferocity was not only
inevitable, but it was in a certain sense
proper; or at least, even if many of its
manifestations were blamable, the spirit
that lay behind them was right. The
backwoodsmen were no sentimentalists;
they were grim, hard, matter-of-fact men,
engaged all their lives long in an unending<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
struggle with hostile forces, both human
and natural; men who in this struggle had
acquired many unamiable qualities, but
who had learned likewise to appreciate at
their full value the inestimable virtues of
courage and common-sense. The crisis
[Revolution] demanded that they should
be both strong and good; but, above all
things, it demanded that they should be
strong. Weakness would have ruined
them. It was needful that justice should
stand before mercy; and they could no
longer have held their homes, had they
not put down their foes, of every kind with
an iron hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these uncouth border families
moved another class of men known as land
speculators. The schemes of these fortune
hunters and of the many great companies
of which they were the representatives
would fill a moderate volume and can only
be hinted at here. As we have noted, a
company was organized very early to
speculate in western lands, called the
Ohio Company. It received from the king
of England a grant of land between the
Monongahela and Great Kanawha Rivers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
but failed to fulfil the required conditions
and the Charter reverted to the Crown.
From that day to the breaking out of the
Revolutionary War numerous land companies
secured by one means or another a
claim to certain lands and many sought such
claims but never secured them. It will be
necessary to refer to one of these companies
later in the course of our narrative.</p>

<p>Near the front in this race for the rich
meadows between the Ohio and Tennessee
were bounty-land claimants. One of Virginia&rsquo;s
most effective pleas for the great
territory which had come into her possession
was that she might reward her soldiers
of the French and Indian wars. While as
a people she had known less of Indian
warfare than some of the colonies, Virginia
had been liberal in sending troops northward
to defend the frontier. And these
Virginians had made a name for themselves
at Braddock&rsquo;s defeat and elsewhere.
Washington was always insistent that the
claims of these old veterans of the bloody
border war be redeemed in good lands, and
it must be remembered ever with pride
that as late as 1770, only six years before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
he became commander-in-chief of the
armies of the United States at Cambridge,
and but two years after the signing of the
Stanwix treaty, he made the difficult journey
to the Ohio River and down that river
in a canoe to Virginia&rsquo;s new empire on the
Great Kanawha, where surveys of bounty
lands for his heroes of Fort Necessity were
first made. Additional surveys were soon
made along the Ohio and Licking Rivers.</p>

<p>Explorers, hunters, squatters, speculators,
and bounty-land claimants&mdash;this was the
heterogeneous population that was surging
westward to the land of which Boone wrote.
But not all came down the old thoroughfare
between the Allegheny and Blue Ridge
Mountains and through Cumberland Gap.
Many followed northward the rough trails
which descended the New and Monongahela
Rivers, while many went northwesterly
over Braddock&rsquo;s overgrown twelve-foot
road or along the winding narrow track of
Forbes&rsquo;s Road through the Pennsylvania
Glades to the little frontier fortress, Fort
Pitt. From the time Bouquet relieved this
beleaguered garrison until the Stanwix
treaty, Pittsburg, as the town was now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
known, had been growing. One year after
that treaty (1769) the manor of Pittsburg
was surveyed, the survey embracing five
thousand seven hundred and sixty-six
acres. Upon the signing of the Stanwix
treaty, Pittsburg became an important point
and was claimed by both Pennsylvania and
Virginia. About it sprang up villages and
from it down the Ohio and up the Allegheny
and Monongahela Rivers settlements
spread. What was loosely known as the
&ldquo;Monongahela Country&rdquo;&mdash;the territory
between the Monongahela and Ohio Rivers&mdash;became
quite populous.</p>

<p>Here, high up along the Ohio River, the
Virginians learned how to fight the red
man, if they had never known before.
The decade succeeding Pontiac&rsquo;s war,
though nominally a peaceful one, was,
nevertheless, one long and bitter duel
between the Indians north of the Ohio and
the Virginians who were coming &ldquo;in
shoals&rdquo; to its southern bank. It has been
estimated that the total loss of life within
that decade was as great as the total loss
in the open war&mdash;Dunmore&rsquo;s War&mdash;which
soon broke out and which momentarily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
threatened the extinction of Virginia&rsquo;s
great colonial movement into the southern
half of this black forest of the West.</p>

<p>We have refrained from using the name
Kentucky long enough, perhaps, to accomplish
the purpose of impressing upon the
reader&rsquo;s mind the part Virginia and the
Virginians played in the creation of the
earliest settlement in the West, first
known as the county, then the state, of
Kentucky. As Professor Shaler has said:
&ldquo;She owes to Virginia the most of the
people she received during the half century
when her society was taking shape:
her institutions, be they good or evil, her
ideals of life, her place in the nation&rsquo;s
history, are all as immediately derived
from her great Mother Virginia as are an
individual man&rsquo;s from the mother who
bore him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The name Kentucky, Kentuckgin, Kantucky,
Kentucke, Caintuck, as it was variously
spelled, may have been derived from
an Iroquois word <i>Ken-ta-kee</i>, which means
&ldquo;among the meadows.&rdquo; When, in the
olden days, only the long, painted canoes
of the Iroquois could be moored in safety<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
in the shades of the woodland meadows
south of the Oyo, the name Ken-ta-kee was
first heard&mdash;a name which has come down
to us so pregnant with pride and power.
The Catawba River, which gained its name,
perhaps, from the famous war-path which
followed it toward the land of the Catawbas
in the south, was first known as the Louisa
River (named by Walker in honor of the
wife of the &ldquo;Bloody Duke&rdquo; of Cumberland),
and afterwards as the Kentucky
River.</p>

<p>After the treaty at the close of Dunmore&rsquo;s
War, Virginia had two quit-claim
deeds to her western empire: one from the
Iroquois, who boasted their possession of
it, and one from the Shawanese, who had
disputed the settlement. There was yet
another claimant to deal with, the Cherokees
of the South. In the year following
the battle of Point Pleasant (1774) a land
company headed by Colonel Richard Henderson
purchased from the Cherokees the
land between the Ohio, Kentucky, and
Cumberland Rivers. This purchase was
achieved at Fort Watauga through the
agency of Daniel Boone. This private<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
purchase from the Indians was afterward
annulled by both Virginia and North Carolina,
but so far as the Indian claims to
Kentucky were concerned it had passed
into the possession of the white man.
Every inch of soil had been fairly obtained
from each and every claimant who had
made it a &ldquo;dark and bloody ground&rdquo;
through their battles for it, since the
earliest period of recorded history. But
at the time of the Cherokee purchase, an
old Indian chief said to Boone: &ldquo;Brother,
we have given you a fine land, but I believe
you will have much trouble in settling
it.&rdquo; Perhaps the Cherokees knew what
Shawanese quit-claim deeds were worth!</p>

<p>After making this purchase for Colonel
Henderson, Boone engaged to mark out a
road through Cumberland Gap to the center
of the newly acquired territory. Following
the old trail through the Gap, Boone&rsquo;s
Road ended at a new settlement at the
mouth of Otter Creek on the Kentucky
River named Boonesborough, in his honor.
Fort Boonesborough was completed July
14, 1775. Colonel Logan and party came
westward through the Gap at the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
time but diverged from Boone&rsquo;s Road on
Rockcastle Creek, and opened the more
important branch of the road toward Louisville
by way of Crab Orchard and Danville,
and erected Fort Logan one mile west of
Standford, in what is now Lincoln County,
Kentucky. Harrod&rsquo;s, Logan&rsquo;s, and Boone&rsquo;s
forts were the important early &ldquo;stations&rdquo; in
the West. To them the thousands wended
their tedious way over the &ldquo;Wilderness
Road,&rdquo; as both branches (Logan&rsquo;s and
Boone&rsquo;s) were fitly called, or down the
Ohio from Pittsburg. And along these
lines of western movement cabins and
clearings made their rapid appearance
despite the era of bloodshed which began
almost simultaneously with the opening of
the Revolutionary War in the East.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such were the pilgrims of the West. It
is interesting to note that these leaders of
civilization in the West were true Americans&mdash;American
born and American bred.
It is remarkable that the discoverers of the
American central West were either French
or American. For the work of exploring this
<i>hinterland</i>, England scarcely furnished a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
man; she can write no names opposite those
of Brul&eacute;, Cartier, Champlain, Du Lhuth,
Hennepin, Joliet, Marquette, and La Salle.
Nearly all that England knew of the interior
she learned from the French. Her
great explorers were maritime explorers
and her conquest of New France was
effected by water. But while the West
could not have for its first colonists the
counterpart of the hardy, irresistible race
who first came to the Atlantic seaboard, it
did have the next best thing&mdash;the direct
descendants of them. It was a race of
Americanized Britons who pressed from
Virginia into the West. Hardly a name
among them but was pure Norman or
Saxon. Of the twenty-five members of the
Political Club at Danville, Kentucky, which
discussed with ability the Federal Constitution,
all but two were descendants of
colonists from Great Britain and Ireland.
Of forty-five members of the convention
which framed Kentucky&rsquo;s first constitution,
only three could claim European ancestry.
Of the seven hundred members of the
Filson Club, the representative historical
society of Kentucky today, there are not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
more than twenty who are not either English,
Scotch, Welsh, or Irish. The blood
of the mother country flowed in purer strain
in no portion of the continent at the outbreak
of the Revolutionary War than in
the Virginian settlement of Kentucky.
That the blood was true to its fighting
traditions is proved by the Revolutionary
pension rolls. In 1840 there were nine
hundred Revolutionary soldiers receiving
pensions in Kentucky. This race gave to
the West its real heroes&mdash;the Gists,
Walkers, Boones, Clarks, Todds, Shelbys,
Kentons, Logans, Lewises, Crawfords, Gibsons,
and St. Clairs. In frontier cabins
they were bred to a free life in a free
land&mdash;worthy successors to Washington
and his school, worthy men to subdue and
rule the empire of which they began the
conquest before the outbreak of the Revolutionary
War. In the form of these
sturdy colonizers the American republic
stretched its arm across the Appalachian
mountain system and took in its grasp the
richest river valley in the world at the end
of Boone&rsquo;s Wilderness Road. That arm
was never withdrawn, that grasp never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
relinquished. The leaven of old Virginia
leavened the whole lump.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus may be outlined briefly the era of
expansion in which Boone&rsquo;s Road played
an all-important part. In the succeeding
chapters the phases of this historic movement
are reviewed as the meager data now
obtainable can permit.</p>

<h3>THE FIRST EXPLORERS</h3>


<p>The first real explorations of the great
territory secured by Virginia at the
Treaty of Fort Stanwix were made
by Dr. Thomas Walker, who later so skilfully
managed Virginia&rsquo;s part of that treaty,
and Christopher Gist, in the early years of
the second half of the eighteenth century,
1750 and 1751.</p>

<p>The brief journals<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> written by these
men are the sources of our first information
concerning the vast territory west of the
Appalachian mountain system&mdash;the eastern
half of the Mississippi basin south of the
Ohio River. They are meager records of
hard day&rsquo;s pilgrimages, an outline of the
routes pursued, and a description of the
lands which were traversed. Both were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
explorers for two newly-formed land
companies. Walker represented the Loyal
Land Company of London, and Gist was
the representative of the Ohio Company.
The company for which Walker acted had
secured a grant of eight hundred thousand
acres in the territory now embraced in
Kentucky north of 36&deg; 30&acute;. The Ohio
Company had a grant of five hundred thousand
acres between the Kanawha and
Monongahela Rivers. These men were
sent to search out favorable lands and
report on the giants and grapes. They
found both.</p>

<p>Little suggestion of the romance and
daring of these historic journeys can be
found in either of the journals of them;
they make slight books. But volumes can
be written on what can be read by the most
careless reader between their few lines.
The long climbing over the almost pathless
mountains, the nights spent in discomfort,
the countless trials, fears, dangers of which
they knew so much and told so little&mdash;all
this should make a story if it never has,
that could not by any means find an uninterested
reader. No youth&rsquo;s history is of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
moment until we know the man and know
that he is a man among men. Our nation
is still a boy. Only with the passing of
the years will its boyhood be studied and
known as it should be known; when that
time comes, the brief stories of such men
as Walker and Gist will appear of priceless
value.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having, on the 12th of December last,
been employed for a certain consideration
to go to the Westward in order to discover
a proper Place for a Settlement, I left my
house on the Sixth day of March, at 10
o&rsquo;clock, 1749-50, in Company with Ambrose
Powell, William Tomlinson, Colby Chew,
Henry Lawless &amp; John Hughs. Each man
had a Horse and we had two to carry the
Baggage. I lodged this night at Col.
Joshua Fry&rsquo;s, in Albemarle, which County
includes the Chief of the head Branches of
James River on the East side of the Blue
Ridge.&rdquo; Thus begins Dr. Walker&rsquo;s journal.
At this time England and her colonies
were dating by the old calendar, each new
year beginning on the twenty-fifth of
March. Accordingly they started nineteen
days before the beginning of the year 1750.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a brave little company of adventurous
men. Walker had attended William
and Mary College, and then had joined the
ranks of that distinguished army of representative
Virginians who, with saddle-bags
and surveying instruments, proved to be the
vanguard of the army which was to achieve
the real conquest of the West. His home
was Castle Hill, near Charlottesville,
Albemarle County, Virginia, where his
companions had rendezvoused for the
present expedition and from which point
they began their historic journey. Powell
was of the best Virginian stock, and has
left his name to one of the great valleys
through which the highway to the West
ran. His son became a Revolutionary
officer and his great-grandson was General
A. P. Hill, the famous Confederate leader.
Chew was from Orange County, Virginia,
and belonged to the Maryland branch of
the Chew family. Two Presidents of the
United States, Madison and Taylor, could
claim him as a relative. Seven years later
he served in Washington&rsquo;s regiment in
Forbes&rsquo;s expedition against Fort Duquesne,
and was killed in Grant&rsquo;s wild attack on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
that fort. As the journal states, this company
spent the first night out with Colonel
Joshua Fry. Fry too was one of them in
spirit, though he did not accompany them
westward. He was a graduate of Oxford
University, joint author with Jefferson of
Fry and Jefferson&rsquo;s celebrated Map of Virginia,
and a commissioner for the crown
in establishing the boundary line between
North Carolina and Virginia. He was
killed by being thrown from his horse
while taking command of Washington&rsquo;s
expedition against Fort Duquesne, four
years later. These statistics show plainly
that the best brain and blood of Virginia
was foremost in attempting to realize
Virginia&rsquo;s dream of conquest and expansion.</p>

<p>But it was a time for brave men to show
themselves. Ambitious Virginia had been
slow to claim the West, where even at this
early date Frenchmen had gone so far into
the wilderness. C&eacute;loron, bold emissary of
the humpbacked Canadian Governor Gallissoni&egrave;re,
was now burying leaden plates at
the mouths of the rivers which emptied
into the Ohio, as a sign of French possession
of the West. One of these was placed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
at the mouth of the Great Kanawha &ldquo;at
the mouth of the river Chinodahihetha,
this 18th day of August,&rdquo; claiming for the
Bourbon crown the entire territory in
which the grant of land to the Ohio Company
was located. There was not a moment
to lose if the West was to be saved to England.
A settlement must be made quickly,
and Walker and his band pushed on immediately
to find a &ldquo;proper Place for a
Settlement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But all this, seemingly, is neither here
nor there&mdash;so far as Walker&rsquo;s Journal is
concerned. There is not one mention of
the political crisis then at hand; instead of
French claims, Walker deals with tired
horses or broken-legged dogs, and where
one might suppose he would mention
national boundary lines he tells only of
cutting names on trees. And at the end,
where the reader might look for a summary
statement of the results of his tour he finds
this: &ldquo;I got home about noon. We killed
in the Journey 13 Buffaloes, 8 Elks, 53
Bears, 20 Deer, 4 Wild Geese, about 150
Turkeys, besides small game. We might
have killed three times as much meat, if we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
had wanted it.&rdquo; Yet, so far as human
interest is concerned, the record is exceptionally
entertaining, and to a student of
the great thoroughfare from Virginia to
Kentucky it is full of meaning; because of
its many references to the difficulties of
traveling at that early date, and to the
varied experiences of explorers on the
earliest thoroughfares westward. It is
this story of experience in traveling west
in 1750 that makes Walker&rsquo;s Journal of
interest in the present study.</p>

<p>On the day after the party left Colonel
Fry&rsquo;s, &ldquo;We set off about 8,&rdquo; writes Dr.
Walker, &ldquo;but the day proving wet, we
only went to Thomas Joplin&rsquo;s on Rockfish.
This is a pretty River, which might at a
small expense be made fit for transporting
Tobacco; but it has lately been stopped by
a Mill Dam near the Mouth to the prejudice
of the upper inhabitants who would at their
own expense clear and make it navigable,
were they permitted.&rdquo; Virginia&rsquo;s great
industry evidently flourished this far from
tidewater even at this early date, though
handicapped by these dams which were
erected by the &ldquo;Averice of Millers,&rdquo; on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
which Dr. Walker comments again in his
next day&rsquo;s record. The record for Sunday,
the eleventh, is appropriately brief: &ldquo;11th.
The Sabbath.&rdquo; In only one or two instances
did the party travel on Sunday,
and then the journey was occasioned by
necessity. On the twelfth the party crossed
the Upper James River above the mouth
of the Rivanna, and lodged with one
Thomas Hunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;13th. We went early to William Calloway&rsquo;s
and supplied ourselves with Rum,
Thread, and other necessaries &amp; from
thence took the main Waggon Road leading
to Wood&rsquo;s or the New River. It is not
well clear&rsquo;d or beaten yet, but will be a
very good one with proper management.&rdquo;
Wood&rsquo;s River&mdash;or New River, as we know
it today&mdash;was discovered in 1671 by Colonel
Abraham Wood, who explored along the
line which later became the boundary line
between North Carolina and Virginia. He
crossed the Alleghenies through &ldquo;Wood&rsquo;s
Gap&rdquo; (now Flower Gap) and, going down
Little River, found New River not far from
Inglis Ferry, where Walker&rsquo;s party crossed
three days later. This mention of the road<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Walker traversed is his first reference to
the great road westward toward Cumberland
Gap; he remarks its roughness, but
before he returned to Virginia he learned
new lessons on rough roads. &ldquo;This night
we lodged in Adam Beards low grounds.
Beard is an ignorant, impudent, brutish
fellow, and would have taken us up, had it
not been for a reason, easily suggested.&rdquo;
When thus brought in contrast with the
hospitality usually tendered Walker&rsquo;s party,
the deportment of this churlish mountaineer
is conspicuous. Travelers on these
first highways were ever in need&mdash;if for
nothing more than a camping-place. The
people who settled beside the frontier roads
were trained by bitter experience to a
generous hospitality. This hospitality
was particularly marked, throughout the
colonies, among those who could afford it,
especially on the frontiers; and here it
was often bestowed upon travelers when it
could be ill-afforded. The modern hotel
has in a large measure relieved the general
public from the burden of continual and
promiscuous hospitality, and it has been
found that where hotels are least known<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
this prime requisite of an expanding
civilization may still be found. On the
frontier, men were dependent on those
who lived beside the road, not only in time
of accident and sickness, but at all times&mdash;for
little food and forage could be carried.
At times travelers nearly perished when
once beyond the frontier line. Walker&rsquo;s
party, though they killed the large amount
of game mentioned, were once compelled
to kill and eat one of their dogs. Captain
Estill, who lost his life in Kentucky in the
engagement which bears his name, is said
to have done a great service for emigrants
from Virginia by killing game and leaving
the meat beside the road, in order to &ldquo;pass
on and notify incoming trains where they
might find a supply of meat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instances of vile treatment of travelers
are not often cited, but the few that exist
are the exceptions that prove the rule of
generosity which was common to the time.</p>

<p>Leaving Beard&rsquo;s, Walker and his men
went, on the fourteenth, to Nicholas Welch&rsquo;s,
&ldquo;where,&rdquo; the Doctor writes, &ldquo;we bought
corn for our horses, and had some Victuals
dress&rsquo;d for Breakfast.&rdquo; From here they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
climbed the Blue Ridge through Buford&rsquo;s
Gap, in Bedford County, through which
the Norfolk and Western Railroad now
passes. &ldquo;The Ascent and Descent is so
easie,&rdquo; writes Walker, &ldquo;that a Stranger
would not know when he crossed the
Ridge.&rdquo; On the day after, they reached
&ldquo;the great Lick&rdquo; near the present city of
Roanoke, and continued up the trail on the
following day to near the historic Inglis
Ferry, not far from the present village of
Blacksburg, Montgomery County, Virginia.</p>

<p>From this on, Walker&rsquo;s route is not of
importance to our study, as he missed the
great trail which would have taken him to
the pleasant meadows of Kentucky&mdash;though
he struck it again at Cumberland Gap
but did not follow it&mdash;and wandered over
a circuitous route thus outlined by Daniel
Bryan: &ldquo;They started from low down
in Virginia, traveled westwardly across
Alleghany Mountains to Chissel&rsquo;s Lead
Mine, on New River; thence into the
Holston Valley, thence over Walden&rsquo;s
Ridge and Powell&rsquo;s Mountain into Powell&rsquo;s
Valley.... They then continued down
the valley, leaving Cumberland Mountain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
a small distance on their right hand, until
they came to Cumberland Gap.... At
the foot of this mountain they fell into an
Indian path leading from the Cherokee
towns on Tennessee River to the Shawnee
Indian towns on the Ohio, which path they
followed down Yellow Creek to the old
ford of Cumberland River.... Thence
they went on the path down the river to
the Flat Lick, eight miles; here they left
the river, continued on the path, turning
more north, crossing some of the head
branches of the Kentucky River over a poor
and hilly country, until they concluded
there was no good country in the West.
They then took an easterly course over the
worst mountains and laurel thickets in the
world.... They crossed the Laurel or
Cumberland Mountain and fell into the
Green brier country, almost starved to
death ... and reached home with life
only to pay for all their trouble and
suffering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Regretting that this opinion of the final
value of Walker&rsquo;s journey cannot be gainsaid,
it is yet of interest to follow his footsteps
and learn what were some of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
experiences of such early explorers as
these.</p>

<p>On the twenty-sixth they &ldquo;left the
Inhabitans,&rdquo; as Dr. Walker called the
line of civilization, and were at last within
the wild land where no settlers had yet
come. On the night of the twenty-ninth
the &ldquo;Dogs were very uneasie,&rdquo; and the
next day, on Reedy Creek, a branch of the
South Fork of the Holston, the tracks of a
party of Indians were discovered, which
explained the restlessness of the dogs. It
is probably little realized in this day how
valuable dogs were to explorers and immigrants.
They were not only of service in
giving warning of the approach of strangers,
but were well-nigh indispensable in
securing game and in searching for lost
horses. Dr. Walker&rsquo;s love for dogs is a tradition
in the family, and his care of them
on this journey is typical of the gentleman
and the wise frontiersman. At the junction
of Reedy Creek and the Holston&mdash;an
historic spot in Tennessee&mdash;Walker found a
gigantic elm tree, which measured twenty-five
feet in circumference at a distance
of three feet from the ground. Pioneers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
and explorers considered the study of
trees a fine art. By this means they
always judged the quality of the soil, and
knew at a glance by the growth that stood
on it the character of any piece of land.
The diaries of all that old school of western
adventurers contain frequent mention of
trees which were an almost infallible criterion
of the soil beneath. Washington
had keen eyes for trees&mdash;as for everything
else&mdash;as illustrated in the journal of his
trip down the Ohio River in 1770. On the
fourth of November he found a sycamore
on the Great Kanawha, in comparison with
which this first elm of Walker&rsquo;s was insignificant.
It measured, three feet from the
ground, forty-five feet in circumference,
and near by stood another measuring thirty-one
feet around. Upon hearing about this
larger tree, some one remarked that Washington
might have told the truth about the
cherry tree but he told a &ldquo;whopper&rdquo; about
the sycamore. But it was not guess-work,
for the record states clearly that the girth
of the larger tree lacked two inches of being
the complete forty-five feet. Trees along
the Ohio grew to an immense size; an old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Ohio River pilot affirms that in his boyhood
a burned trunk of a sycamore stood on his
father&rsquo;s farm on the Little Muskingum, into
which he has frequently driven a horse,
turned it about, and come out again. General
Harmar found on the Ohio a button-wood
tree forty-two feet in circumference,
which held forty men within its trunk.</p>

<p>On the seventh of April Dr. Walker
writes: &ldquo;It snowed most of the day. In
the Evening our dogs caught a large He
Bear, which before we could come up to
shoot him had wounded a dog of mine, so
that he could not Travel, and we carried
him on Horseback, till he recovered.&rdquo; On
the thirteenth the party reached &ldquo;Cave
Gap,&rdquo; which Walker named Cumberland
Gap in honor of the &ldquo;bloody Duke,&rdquo; the
hero of Culloden. &ldquo;Just at the foot of
the Hill is a Laurel Thicket.... On the
South side is a plain Indian Road. On the
top of the Ridge are Laurel Trees marked
with crosses, others Blazed and several
Figures on them.... This Gap may be
seen at a considerable distance, and there
is no other, that I know of, except one
about two miles to the North of it, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
does not appear to be so low as the other.
The Mountain on the North Side of the
Gap is very Steep and Rocky, but on the
South side it is not So. We called it Steep
Ridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The party crossed the Cumberland River
about four miles below the present village
of Barbourville, Knox County, Kentucky,
on the twenty-third of April. The river
was named by Walker at this time. From
this spot Walker, with two companions
chosen by lot&mdash;Powell and Chew&mdash;went
on a tour of exploration alone, leaving the
others &ldquo;to provide and salt some Bear,
build an house, and plant some Peach
Stones and Corn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker and his two companions floundered
about the neighboring region for
five days, not getting out of the mountainous
country and not finding any good land.
They crossed the Cumberland again, on
the third day out, about twenty miles below
the first crossing-place, and then returned
up the river to the main party and found
that the work he had ordered to be done
was completed. &ldquo;The People I had left
had built an House 12 by 8, clear&rsquo;d and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
broke up some ground, &amp; planted Corn, and
Peach Stones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus was raised, beside the tumbling
Cumberland, on the farm now owned by
George M. Faulkner four miles below Barbourville,
Kentucky, the first house now
recorded as built by white men in the fine
territory between the Cumberland Mountains
and the Ohio River, now the state of
Kentucky. It was not an &ldquo;improver&rsquo;s
cabin&rdquo;&mdash;a log pen without roof&mdash;but a
roofed house, and instituted what the
English Loyal Land Company could claim
to be a &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; in the territory which
they had been granted. This was completed
by the planting of corn and peach
trees. The formality of this &ldquo;settlement&rdquo;
is evinced by the fact that, two days later,
the entire party moved on for further
exploration, never again to return to their
house or to reap their crops. It was twenty
years before a house was erected in Kentucky
for the permanent dwelling.</p>

<p>From this on, Dr. Walker&rsquo;s journal is a
long story of accidents and disappointments.
One horse became lame, and &ldquo;another had
been bit in the Nose by a Snake.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>&rdquo;
&ldquo;I rub&rsquo;d the wounds with Bear&rsquo;s oil, and
gave him a drench of the same and another
of the decoction of Rattle Snake root some
time after.&rdquo; On the same day &ldquo;Colby
Chew and his Horse fell down the Bank.
I Bled and gave him Volatile drops, &amp; he
soon recovered.&rdquo; On the first of May they
reached Powell&rsquo;s River. This was named
from Ambrose Powell. During the journey
Dr. Walker gave the name of each of
his companions to rivers he discovered;
none were given his name, though a mountain
range to the north of Fort Chiswell
still bears the name of Walker&rsquo;s Mountain.
On Powell&rsquo;s River the party this day again
struck the Indian path which later became
the great highway to Kentucky. Again
he was on the route that would have taken
him to the famous meadows below the foothills
of the mountains, and again he left it
as he did when he chose to explore on the
south side of Cumberland Mountain,
instead of crossing at Pineville and following
the trail northward. He did not cross
Rockcastle River. J. Stoddard Johnson
says: &ldquo;This was the farthest western point
reached by Doctor Walker. He did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
cross the main Rockcastle River, and,
therefore, was never on the waters of Salt
or Green rivers, as claimed by some. A
day or two&rsquo;s travel to the west or northwest
would have brought him to the fertile
lands of Lincoln or Madison County, his
description of which would have left no
doubt of his having passed the watershed
between the Rockcastle, the Salt, and the
rivers to the westward.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Shoes formed an important item in the
catalogue of necessaries for the early traveler&rsquo;s
outfit on the first traveled ways in
America. Already Walker&rsquo;s party, though
they traveled largely by horse, had worn
out the shoes with which they started, and
on the eleventh of May under one of the
great cliffs near Rockcastle River they set
to work to make themselves new shoes out
of elkskin. &ldquo;When our Elk&rsquo;s Skin was
prepared,&rdquo; writes Dr. Walker on the fourteenth,
&ldquo;we had lost every Awl that we
brought out, and I made one with the Shank
of an old Fishing hook, the other People
made two of Horse Shoe Nails, and with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
these we made our Shoes and Moccosons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the twenty-third the party was on the
Kentucky River, where Walker found a
sycamore which measured forty feet in
circumference&mdash;almost, it will be seen, the
size of the tree Washington found on the
Great Kanawha&mdash;upon which he marked
his initials, &ldquo;T. W.&rdquo; On the day after, he
found another sycamore thirty feet in circumference.
These trees, it would naturally
be inferred, marked the location of
fertile soil. On the twenty-sixth the
&ldquo;Dogs roused a large Buck Elk, which we
followed down to a Creek. He killed
Ambrose Powell&rsquo;s Dog in the Chase, and
we named the Run Tumbler&rsquo;s Creek, the
Dog being of that Name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;31st. We crossed 2 Mountains and
camped just by a Wolf&rsquo;s Den. They were
very impudent and after they had twice
been shot at, they kept howling about the
Camp. It rained till Noon this day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;June ye 1st. We found the Wolf&rsquo;s
Den and caught 4 of the young ones.&rdquo; It
was very common for frontiersmen to
invade the dens of wolves without any
opposition on the part of the old wolves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Wolf cubs have often been pulled away
from their mothers, who would only snarl
and show their teeth. Bears, on the other
hand, would fight to the death any invader
of their dens. Notions which commonly
prevail today, about the dangers in the
primeval forests of America from wild
animals, undergo a great change after a
careful reading of pioneer literature.</p>

<p>On the fourth of June &ldquo;a very black
Cloud appearing, we turn&rsquo;d out our Horses,
got tent Poles up, and were just stretching
a Tent, when it began to rain and hail,
and was succeeded by a violent Wind which
Blew down our Tent &amp; a great many Trees
about it, several large ones within 30 yds.
of the Tent. We all left the place in confusion
and ran different ways for shelter.
After the Storm was over, we met at the
Tent, and found all safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the fourteenth the party had gone
east as far as the dividing ridge between
the two forks of the Big Sandy; but within
a few days the horses were spent, and the
whole party floundered onward afoot. On
the twentieth they reached Flat-top Mountain,
Raleigh County, West Virginia. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
day Dr. Walker&rsquo;s horse was bitten by a
snake; &ldquo;... having no Bear&rsquo;s Oil,&rdquo; he
wrote, &ldquo;I rub&rsquo;d the place with a piece of
fat meat, which had the desired effect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Passing the present site of Hinton, West
Virginia, the party followed about the
present line of the Chesapeake and Ohio
Railway. They crossed the Allegheny
divide July 8, and Hot Springs the ninth.
They found &ldquo;Six Invalides there. The
Spring Water is very Clear &amp; warmer than
new Milk, and there is a spring of cold
Water within 20 feet of the Warm one. I
left one of my Company this day.&rdquo; They
reached Augusta Court House (Staunton,
Virginia) on the eleventh, and Castle Hill
on the sixteenth, having been four months
and seven days on the journey.</p>

<p>Walker&rsquo;s hard tour amounted to very
little for the plain reason that he never got
west of the mountains. He found no good
land and his report was depressing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It remained for another brave frontiersman
to go further and bring back the
welcome news of large areas of splendid
land in the Ohio Valley. In 1748 John<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Hanbury, London merchant; Thomas Lee,
President of the Council of Virginia; and
a number of prominent Virginians formed
the Ohio Company, elsewhere mentioned,
and received a large grant of land in the
West. The grant was made March 18,
1749: two hundred thousand acres between
the Monongahela and Great Kanawha
Rivers, and later three hundred thousand
acres, to be located on the waters of the
lower Ohio. In 1750 this company employed
Christopher Gist, a hardy, well-trained
frontiersman who lived on the
Yadkin in North Carolina, to explore the
Ohio Valley and make a report upon the
land there found. For his arduous service
he was to receive one hundred and fifty
pounds sterling &ldquo;and such further handsome
allowance as his service should
deserve.&rdquo; His instructions read as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are to go out as soon as possible
to the Westward of the great Mountains,
and carry with you such a Number of Men
as You think necessary, in Order to Search
out and discover the Lands upon the river
Ohio &amp; other adjoining Branches of the
Mississippi down as low as the great Falls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
thereof: You are particularly to observe
the Ways &amp; Passes thro all the Mountains
you cross, &amp; take an exact Account of the
Soil, Quality &amp; Product of the Land, and
the Wideness and Deepness of the Rivers,
&amp; the several Falls belonging to them,
together with the Courses &amp; Bearings of
the Rivers &amp; Mountains as near as you
conveniently can: You are also to observe
what Nations of Indians inhabit there,
their Strength and Numbers, who they
trade with, &amp; in what Comodities they deal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you find a large quantity of
good, level Land, such as you think will
suit the Company, You are to measure the
Breadth of it, in three or four different
Places, &amp; take the Courses of the River &amp;
Mountains on which it binds in Order to
judge the Quantity: You are to fix the
Beginning &amp; Bounds in such a Manner that
they may be easily found again by your
Description; the nearer in the Land lies
the better, provided it be good &amp; level,
but we had rather go quite down the Mississippi
than take mean broken Land.
After finding a large Body of good level
Land, you are not to stop but proceed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
further, as low as the Falls of the Ohio,
that we may be informed of that Navigation;
And You are to take an exact Account
of all the large Bodies of good level Land,
in the same Manner as above directed that
the Company may the better judge when
it will be most convenient for them to take
their Land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are to note all the Bodies of good
Land as you go along, tho there is not a
sufficient Quantity for the Company&rsquo;s
Grant, but You need not be so particular
in the Mensuration of that, as in the larger
Bodies of Land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are to draw as good a plan as you
can of the Country You pass thro: You
are to take an exact and particular Journal
of all Your Proceedings, and make a true
Report thereof to the Ohio Company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gist was the man for the business in
hand. He came from an enterprising
family and was well educated. His father
was one of the Commissioners for laying
off the city of Baltimore. &ldquo;Little is known
of his early life, but the evidences he has
left in his journals, his maps, plats of surveys,
and correspondence indicate that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
enjoyed the advantages of an education
superior to that of many of his calling in
those early days. His signature and
manuscript are characterized by the neatness
and uniformity of a copy plate, while
his plats and surveys are models in their
mathematical exactness and precision of
drawing. To this evidence of scholarly
order and professional skill he added the
hardy qualities of the pioneer and backwoodsman,
capable of enduring the exposure
of long journeys in the most rigorous
weather. In him were combined the
varied talents which made him at once an
accomplished surveyor, an energetic farmer
who felled the forest and tilled the soil, a
skilful diplomat who understood the Indian
character and was influential in making
treaties, a brave soldier, an upright man,
trusted by the highest civil and military
authorities with implicit faith.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The earlier portion of Gist&rsquo;s journey,
which he began in October, 1750, is not of
importance in the present monograph. He
reached the Ohio River by way of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Juniata and Kiskiminitas Rivers. Crossing
the Ohio he worked his way westward on
the Great Trail to the &ldquo;Crossing Place of
the Muskingum&rdquo; (Bolivar, Ohio), and from
thence he traversed the Indian trail to the
country of the Shawanese and Miamis.</p>

<p>It was not until Tuesday, the twelfth of
March, that Gist again crossed the Ohio, and
entered what is now the state of Kentucky.
His first day&rsquo;s experience was typical&mdash;in
a land so well known for great things and
strong; for on the day after crossing at
the Shawanese Shannoah Town, he found
two men who had &ldquo;Two of the Teeth of a
large Beast.... The Rib Bones of the
largest of these Beasts were eleven Feet
long, and the Skull Bone six Feet wide,
across the Forehead, &amp; the other Bones in
Proportion; and that there were several
Teeth there, some of which he called
Horns, and said they were upwards of five
Feet long, and as much as a Man could
well carry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gist was now in Kentucky&mdash;the land of
which thousands were waiting to hear, the
home of the race that was to come and conquer
and settle and hold the West. Of it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Gist came to know only a little, but this
little was the beginning of a revelation.</p>

<p>After crossing the Ohio, Gist journeyed
over a hundred miles down the southern
bank of the river, and on March eighteenth
crossed &ldquo;the lower Salt Lick Creek,&rdquo; the
Licking River. Reports of Indians at the
&ldquo;Falls&rdquo; and &ldquo;the footsteps of some
Indians plain on the Ground&rdquo; made him
desist from visiting that spot, but he took
down descriptions of it. On the nineteenth
he turned southward into the interior. On
the twentieth he ascended Pilot Knob, near
Clay City, Powell County, and writes of the
view from that height from which he saw,
as John Finley wrote later, &ldquo;with pleasure
the beautiful level of Kentucky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With but a glimpse of the good lands of
Kentucky, Gist, like Walker before him,
journeyed into the mountainous country to
the southeast. For a month he floundered
around in the desolate laurel ridges where
Walker had spent so many distressing days
the year before. On Red River Gist crossed
Walker&rsquo;s route and came on homeward
between Walker&rsquo;s outward and homeward
courses. From Red River he went through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Pound Gap and eastward, down what is
known as Gist&rsquo;s or Guesse&rsquo;s Fork of the
Clinch in Wise County, Virginia, and then
upon Bluestone, a tributary of New River.
On the thirteenth of May he crossed
Walker&rsquo;s route again at Inglis Ferry, near
Draper&rsquo;s Meadows. On the seventeenth
he passed into North Carolina through
Flower or Wood&rsquo;s Gap toward his home on
the Yadkin. He reached home on the
eighteenth and found that his family had
removed to Roanoke, thirty-five miles eastward,
because of depredations of the Indians
during the winter.</p>

<p>Gist&rsquo;s journey was far more successful
than Walker&rsquo;s. He found the fine fertile
valleys of the Muskingum, Scioto, and
Miami Rivers north of the Ohio, and he
caught a glimpse of the beautiful meadows
of Kentucky. He singularly made a complete
circle about the land between the
Monongahela and Kanawha Rivers, where
the Ohio Company&rsquo;s grant of land was
made. As he did not approach it on any
side it is probable that he knew that only
rough land lay there. Had it not been for
the sudden breaking out of the old French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
War, the Ohio Company would undoubtedly
have settled on lands in the Ohio Valley
according to Gist&rsquo;s advice. Hostilities on
the frontier soon drove back the farther
settlements, and rendered activities in the
land Gist had discovered out of the question,
either on the part of land companies
or private individuals.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>ANNALS OF THE ROAD</h3>


<p>With the close of Pontiac&rsquo;s Rebellion
and the passing away of the war
clouds which had hung so long over
the West, ten thousand eyes turned longingly
across the Alleghenies and Blue
Ridge. War with all its horrors had yet
brought something of good, for never before
had the belief that a splendidly fertile
empire lay to the westward taken such a
hold upon the people of Virginia. Nothing
more was needed but the positive assurance
of large areas of good land, and a way to
reach it. It was ten years after the close
of Pontiac&rsquo;s war before both of these conditions
were fulfilled.</p>

<p>First came the definite assurance that the
meadows of Kentucky were what Gist and
others had reported them to be. The
Proclamation of 1763, forbidding western
settlement, did not forbid hunting in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
West&mdash;and the great emigration which
started as slow as a glacier was finally put
into motion by the proof brought back to
North Carolina and Virginia by the hunters
(of whom mention has been made) who
went over the mountains between 1763
and 1773. In 1766 Colonel James Smith,
undaunted by his captivity among the
Indians, hunted through the southern
portion of Kentucky. In 1767 John Finley
traded with the Indians in northern Kentucky,
and James Harrod and Michael
Stoner were in the southern portion of the
country. Finally, in 1769 Daniel Boone
came into the land &ldquo;a second Adam in
another Eden.&rdquo; Boone reached the edge
of the beautiful Blue Grass Region and
returned home in 1771 to tell of what he
saw, and to bring his family &ldquo;as soon as
possible to live in Kentucky, which I
esteemed a second paradise, at the risk of
my life and fortune.&rdquo; In 1769 also, the
party of stout hunters headed by Colonel
James Knox reached Kentucky, and hunted
on the Green and Lower Cumberland
Rivers; they were so long absent from
home that they were given the name of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
&ldquo;The Long Hunters.&rdquo; These, too,
brought glowing descriptions of the fine
meadows of <i>Ken-ta-kee</i>.</p>

<p>At once the forests were filled with
cohorts of surveyors&mdash;the vanguard of the
host under whose feet the continent was
soon to tremble. These surveyors represented
the various land companies and the
bounty land seekers, who had a claim to
the two hundred thousand acres promised
the Virginian soldiers in the old French
war. Scores of cabins were raised in 1774
at Harrodsburg, near Danville, on the east
fork of Salt River, on Dick&rsquo;s River, and
on Salt River. Their erection marks the
beginning of the first settlement of the
land one year previous to the breaking
out of the war of the Revolution.</p>

<p>These first comers found their way to
Kentucky by two routes&mdash;the Warriors&rsquo;
Path through Cumberland Gap, and the
Ohio River, which they reached either by
the Kittanning Path up the Juniata or by
Braddock&rsquo;s or Forbes&rsquo;s Roads. Each route
was dangerous and difficult beyond description.
It was a terrible road from Cumberland
to Pittsburg, and the journey down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
the Ohio was not more inviting. When
the river was high and afforded safe navigation
it was as much a highway for red men
as for white&mdash;and these were treacherous
times. When the river was low, a thousand
natural obstructions tended to daunt even
the bravest boatmen&mdash;and the Virginian
backwoodsmen were not educated to contend
with such a dangerous stream as the
Ohio, with its changing currents, treacherous
eddies, and thousands of sunken trees.
One frontiersman who made the river trip
at an early date, cautioned those who
essayed the trip against rowing their boats
at night; lest the sound of the oars should
prevent the watchman from hearing the
&ldquo;riffling&rdquo; of the water about the rocks and
sunken trees, on which many a boat had
been wrecked with all its precious freight.
The danger of river travel down such a
stream appealed with tremendous force to
the early pioneers, with the result that the
majority chose the land route.</p>

<p>But what an alternative! A narrow trail
in the forests six hundred miles in length
was the only path. It had been traversed
by many even as early as 1775, but each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
traveler had made it worse, and the
story of the hardships of the journey
through &ldquo;the Wilderness&rdquo; would make
even the bravest pause. It is a hard journey
today, one which cannot be made
without taxing even the strongest; what
was it before the route was dotted with
cities and hamlets, before the road had been
widened and bridged, before the mountains
had been graded and the swamps drained,
before the fierce lurking enemies had been
driven away?</p>

<p>Neither Walker nor Gist traversed what
became the famed Wilderness Road to
Kentucky. When the Shawanese raided
Draper&rsquo;s Meadows, near Inglis Ferry, in
1755, they took their prisoners away on the
trail through Powell&rsquo;s Valley toward Cumberland
Gap; and the rescuing party which
followed them were perhaps the first white
men who traveled what became the great
pioneer thoroughfare to Kentucky. It
was, undoubtedly, the route followed by
the early hunters who passed through
Cumberland Gap and found the fertile
meadows of which Dr. Walker was ignorant,
and of which Christopher Gist caught<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
only a faint glimpse. Settlements sprang
up slowly beyond Inglis Ferry, but by the
time of Boone&rsquo;s return in 1771 a few families
were on the upper waters of the
Holston, and settlements had been made
on the Watauga where Fort Watauga was
soon to be built, and at Wolf Hills, now
Abington. These settlements were all one
hundred miles east of Cumberland Gap,
and the little path thither was not yet
marked for white man&rsquo;s use.</p>

<p>But the brave Boone was as good as his
word&mdash;and he did attempt to bring his
family and five other families to Kentucky
in the year 1773, over what was soon to be
known as Boone&rsquo;s Road. This was the
beginning of the great tide of immigration
through Cumberland Gap, a social movement
which for timeliness and ultimate success
ranks as the most important in the history
of the central West. This initial attempt
was not a success, for the party was
driven back by Indians, with loss, entirely
discouraged. But from this time on, despite
Dunmore&rsquo;s War which now broke out, the
dream of western immigration could not be
forgotten.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>But all the western movement was now
put at hazard by the outbreak of this cruel,
bloody war between the &ldquo;Long Knives&rdquo;&mdash;as
the Virginians in the Monongahela
country came to be called, from the sabres
that hung at their loins&mdash;and the Shawanese
north of the Ohio. As suggested, the
preceding years had been marked by continual
bloodshed. It is undoubtedly true
that those Long Knives on the upper Ohio
had been doing some dreadful slashing.
Perhaps the provocations were as enormous
as the crimes; surely the Indians to the
north were the most bloodthirsty and cruel
of any on the continent. At the same time
it is safe to say that many of their white
foes on the Ohio were inhuman marauders,
whose principal occupation was that of
shooting game for a living and Indians for
sport. Even in the statement in Boone&rsquo;s
autobiography there is a plain suggestion
of a guilty conscience on the part of those
of whom he wrote: &ldquo;The settlers [in the
Monongahela country], now aware that a
general warfare would be commenced by
the Indians, immediately sent an express
to Williamsburg, the seat of government<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
in Virginia, communicating their apprehensions
and soliciting protection.&rdquo; How
aware? Because some of the relatives of
the Indian chieftain Logan had been basely
murdered, while intoxicated, on Yellow
Creek?</p>

<p>The Virginian House of Burgesses was
quick to answer this appeal of the western
colonists, and Governor Dunmore&rsquo;s earnestness
in arranging the campaign resulted
in the short wars bearing his name. General
Andrew Lewis, a hero of Braddock&rsquo;s
defeat, was commissioned to raise an army
of border settlers and march down the
Great Kanawha; while Lord Dunmore
went northward to Pittsburg, where, in
the Monogahela country, he would recruit
another army and descend the Ohio to the
mouth of the Great Kanawha. Here the
armies would unite to pierce the valley of
the Scioto in which the hell-hound Shawanese
dwelt.</p>

<p>Lewis gathered an army of eleven hundred
experienced borderers from the
Watauga settlement and the Greenbriar
Valley, and marched swiftly northward.
But the enemy knew of his approach, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
instead of joining Dunmore&rsquo;s army at the
mouth of the Great Kanawha he met a
barricaded Indian horde, equal in size to
his own army, and the bloody and momentous
battle of Point Pleasant was fought
and won. Arriving at the Ohio, Lewis
encamped on the point of land between the
two rivers. Soon two hunters pursuing a
deer encountered the Indian vanguard
which was bearing down on the ill-placed
army of whites. One hunter fell dead and
the other returned with the alarming news.
General Lewis, a pupil in that school on
Braddock&rsquo;s Road, lit his pipe and ordered
the assault. Two regiments advanced on
the Indian line, which now ranged from
river to river, completely cutting it off
from retreat. Both colonels commanding
were soon killed and their men began to
fall back disconcerted. Re&euml;nforcements
drove the redskins back to their entrenchments,
and renewed confidence. But at
last fighting became desperate. Among his
Virginians, the brave Flemming, twice
wounded, kept repeating his order, &ldquo;Advance,
outflank the enemy and get between
them and the river.&rdquo; Among his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
desperate followers the calm voice of Cornstalk
was heard all day long: &ldquo;Be brave, be
brave, be brave!&rdquo; As in the battle of Bushy
Run, where the hope of the West lay with
Bouquet as it did now with Lewis, so at Point
Pleasant no way of success was left, at the
close of that October day, save in strategy.
The white man did not learn to conquer
the red until he learned to deal with him
on his own terms of cunning and deceit.</p>

<p>In desperation Lewis sent three companies
up the Great Kanawha under cover of
the bank to Crooked Creek. Ascending
this stream with great caution, these heroes
of the day rushed from its bed upon the
enemy&rsquo;s flank, and the tide of the battle
was turned. The Indians, though having
suffered least, fell back across the
Ohio to their villages to the northward.
The proposed junction of the two white
armies was achieved, but Lewis had already
sufficiently awed the Shawanese, who came
to Dunmore&rsquo;s Camp Charlotte in their
valley, and gave their affirmation to the Fort
Stanwix Treaty, which surrendered to the
whites all the territory south of the Ohio
and north of the Tennessee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>In less than a year Boone went through
the Gap alone to the &ldquo;Falls of the
Ohio&rdquo; (Louisville), and returned in safety,
more possessed than ever with the ambition
to take his family to the El Dorado
which he had discovered, and of which he
spoke in the enthusiastic vein which has
already been quoted. He had found the
splendid lands of which Gist had guessed;
he had found a straight path thither. All
that was lacking was an impetus to turn a
floodtide of Virginians and their neighbors
into the new land.</p>

<p>This came, too, within a year after the
close of Dunmore&rsquo;s War&mdash;an artificial
impetus in the shape of a land company,
headed by a brave, enterprising man, Colonel
Richard Henderson, with whom were
associated eight other North Carolinians of
high social standing. Richard Henderson
was the son of Samuel Henderson (1700)
and Elizabeth Williams (1714). He was
born in Hanover County, Virginia, on the
twentieth of April, 1735. His two well-known
brothers, Nathaniel and Pleasant,
were born in 1736 and 1756, respectively.
The sons were worthy of their good Scotch-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>Welsh
ancestry. When Richard was about
ten years of age his father moved from their
home in Virginia to Granville County in
the province of North Carolina. Here the
elder Henderson was afterward appointed
sheriff of his county, and the young Richard
was soon able to assist his father by doing
the business &ldquo;of the sherriffltry.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>After this practical introduction to the
science of law young Richard turned to the
theoretical study, and read law for a
twelve-month with his cousin, Judge Williams.
In that day a prospective barrister
was compelled to get a certificate from the
chief-justice of his colony; this he presented
to the governor, who, being satisfied
as to the candidate&rsquo;s acquirements, gave
him a license. Richard Henderson&rsquo;s self-confidence
and genuine talent are exhibited
by the story which his brother records, of
his attempting to obtain a license to practice
law after the brief period of study
mentioned above.</p>

<p>Procuring a certificate from the chief-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>justice
he presented himself to the governor
of North Carolina as a candidate for a
license.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you read law and what
books have you studied?&rdquo; asked the governor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twelve months,&rdquo; replied young Henderson,
naming the books he had used.</p>

<p>The governor replied brusquely that it
was wholly unnecessary for him to take
the time to give an examination, as no one
could in that length of time and with such
books become proficient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Richard Henderson not
a whit dismayed, &ldquo;I am an applicant for
examination; it is your duty to examine
me and if found worthy, to grant me a
license; if otherwise, to refuse one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It can well be imagined how quickly the
governor bristled up and how mercilessly
he would &ldquo;quiz&rdquo; a lad who informed him
in such a spirited manner what the duties
of his office required of him. But the running
fire of questions did not daunt the
candidate more than had the governor&rsquo;s
indifference&mdash;and the young Richard
received at the close of the interview, not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
only a license, but what meant more, many
encomiums from his governor.</p>

<p>Henderson soon acquired a good practice
and became a judge on the bench of the
Superior Court. In 1774 the conflict
with the British agent in North Carolina
was precipitated, and the colonial government
was abolished. It was at this time
that Judge Henderson became interested
in the desire of the Cherokee Indians
to sell land. Henderson&rsquo;s plan was
to purchase from the Cherokees the great
territory lying south of the Kentucky
River&mdash;one-half the present state of Kentucky.
This was quite against the laws
and traditions of the only colony which
had any valid claim to the territory&mdash;Virginia,
his native state&mdash;but this seemed
to matter not to Henderson and his associates;
these were John Williams, under
whom Henderson had studied law, Leonard
Henley Bullock, James Hogg, Nathaniel
Thomas, David Hart, John Luttrell, and
William Johnstone. At the very beginning
of the century Virginia had passed an act
forbidding the private purchase of lands
from the Indians. The founders of Tran<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>sylvania
evidently doubted Virginia&rsquo;s
sweeping claims to the entire interior of
the continent&mdash;at any rate land companies
seemed to be the only means by which the
vast wildernesses beyond the mountains
could be opened up and settled. Though
Virginia soon proved the invalidity of
the purchase, she at the same time was
frank enough to admit that Henderson&rsquo;s
Company had done a good work in giving
an impetus to westward expansion, by
appropriately recompensing the North
Carolinians for their expenditure and
labors.</p>

<p>Henderson&rsquo;s purchase was gigantic in
its proportions, embracing nearly twenty
million acres. The consideration was ten
thousand pounds sterling. The purchase
was made at the advance settlement at
Watauga, March 17, 1775&mdash;only a month
before the outbreak at Lexington and Concord.
Henderson employed Boone to assist
in the transaction, and immediately after
engaged him to mark out the road through
Cumberland Gap to a settlement in Kentucky,
where the Transylvania Company
(as Henderson strangely named his organ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>ization)
was to begin the occupation of
the empire it had nominally secured. Of
this Boone writes modestly that he was
&ldquo;solicited by a number of North Carolina
gentlemen, that were about purchasing the
lands lying on the south side of the Kentucky
River, from the Cherokee Indians,
to attend their treaty at Watauga, in March,
1775, to negotiate with them, and mention
the boundaries of the purchase. This I
accepted, and at the request of the same
gentlemen undertook to mark out a road
in the best passage from the settlement
through the wilderness to Kentucky, with
such assistance as I thought necessary to
employ for such an important undertaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As in the case of Nemacolin&rsquo;s Path
across the Alleghenies, so now a second
westward Indian pathway was blazed for
white man&rsquo;s use; and if the Transylvania
Colony can in no other respect be said to
have been successful, it certainly conferred
an inestimable good upon Virginia and
North Carolina and the nation, when it
marked out through the hand of Boone the
Wilderness Road to Kentucky. From
Watauga the path led up to the Gap, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
it joined the great Warrior&rsquo;s Path which
came down through Kentucky from the
Scioto Valley in Ohio. For about fifty
miles Boone&rsquo;s Road followed this path
northward, whereupon, leaving the Indian
trail, Boone bore to the west, marking his
course on a buffalo trace toward &ldquo;Hazel
Patch&rdquo; to the Rockcastle. The buffalo
path was followed onward up Roundstone
Creek, through &ldquo;Boone&rsquo;s Gap&rdquo; in Big
Hill; through the present county of
Madison, Kentucky; and down little Otter
Creek to the Kentucky River. Here
Boonesborough was built for the Transylvania
Colony, which became the temporary
center of Kentucky.</p>

<p>Felix Walker, one of Boone&rsquo;s road-making
party, made an autobiographical
statement about 1824 of this brave attempt
to cut a white man&rsquo;s path into Kentucky.
From this statement these quotations from
De Bow&rsquo;s <i>Review</i> (1854) are pertinent:</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;The treaty (at Watauga) being concluded
and the purchase made, we proceeded
on our journey to meet Col. Daniel Boon,
with other adventurers, bound to the same
country; accordingly we met and rendez<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>voused
at the Long Island on Holsteen
river, united our small force with Colonel
Boon and his associates, his brother, Squire
Boon, and Col. Richard Callaway, of Virginia.
Our company, when united,
amounted to 30 persons. We then, by
general consent, put ourselves under the
management and control of Col. Boon, who
was to be our pilot and conductor through
the wilderness, to the promised land....
About the 10th of March we put off from
the Long Island, marked out our track with
our hatchets, crossed Clinch and Powell&rsquo;s
river, over Cumberland mountain, and
crossed Cumberland river&mdash;came to a
watercourse called by Col.&mdash;Rockcastle
river; killed a fine bear on our way, camped
all night and had an excellent supper. On
leaving that river, we had to encounter and
cut our way through a country of about
twenty miles, entirely covered with dead
brash, which we found a difficult and
laborious task. At the end of which we
arrived at the commencement of a cane
country, traveled about thirty miles through
thick cane and reed, and as the cane ceased,
we began to discover the pleasing and rap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>turous
appearance of the plains of Kentucky.
A new sky and strange earth
seemed to be presented to our view....
A sad reverse overtook us two days after,
on our way to Kentucky river. On the
25th of March, 1775, we were fired on by
the Indians, in our camp asleep, about an
hour before day. Capt. Twetty was shot
in both knees, and died the third day after.
A black man, his body servant, killed dead;
myself badly wounded; our company dispersed.
So fatal and tragical an event cast
a deep gloom of melancholy over all our
prospects, and high calculations of long
life and happy days in our newly-discovered
country were prostrated; hope vanished
from the most of us, and left us suspended
in the tumult of uncertainty and conjecture.
Col. Boon, and a few others, appeared to
possess firmness and fortitude. In our
calamitous situation, a circumstance occurred
one morning after our misfortunes
that proved the courage and stability of our
few remaining men (for some had gone
back). One of our men, who had run off
at the fire of the Indians on our camp, was
discovered peeping from behind a tree, by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
a black woman belonging to Colonel Callaway,
while gathering some wood. She
ran in and gave the alarm of Indians.
Colonel Boon instantly caught his rifle,
ordered the men to form, take trees, and
give battle, and not to run till they saw
him fall. They formed agreeably to his
directions, and I believe they would have
fought with equal bravery to any Spartan
band ever brought to the field of action,
when the man behind the tree announced
his name and came in.... At length
I was carried in a litter between two horses,
twelve miles, to Kentucky river, where we
made a station, and called it Boonsborough,
situated in a plain on the south side of the
river, wherein was a lick with two sulphur
springs strongly impregnated.... In
the sequel and conclusion of my narrative
I must not neglect to give honor to whom
honor is due. Colonel Boone conducted
the company under his care through the
wilderness, with great propriety, intrepidity
and courage; and was I to enter an exception
to any part of his conduct, it would be
on the ground that he appeared void of fear
and of consequence&mdash;too little caution for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the enterprise. But let me, with feeling
recollection and lasting gratitude, ever
remember the unremitting kindness, sympathy,
and attention paid to me by Col.
Boone in my distress. He was my father,
my physician, and friend; he attended me
as his child, cured my wounds by the use
of medicines from the woods, nursed me
with paternal affection until I recovered,
without the expectation of reward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was altogether fitting that among the
very first to follow Boone&rsquo;s blazed road to
Kentucky we should find Judge Henderson
and his fellow-promoters of the Transylvania
Company. Nothing shows more
plainly the genuineness of their purposes
and the heroism of their spirit. They were
not foisting on their countrymen a hazardous
scheme by which they should profit,
while others bore the brunt of the toil and
danger. True, Henderson had, purposely
or unwittingly, ignored the technicality of
Virginia&rsquo;s claim to the possession of the
West; but, with an honesty unparalleled
at that day in such matters, they met the
representatives of the real owners of the
lands they desired, and had purchased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
them and paid down the purchase money.
There is almost no doubt that they could
have satisfied Virginia&rsquo;s technicalities at a
less cost; and then have gone, as so many
have done, to fortify their possessions and
&ldquo;fight it out&rdquo; with the genuine owners of
the soil, who would eventually get nothing
and lose everything.</p>

<p>This Judge Henderson did not do; nor
did he sit down comfortably at home and
send others to turn his holdings into money.
He arose and started&mdash;amid dangers that
shall not be mentioned lest they be minimized&mdash;for
far-away Kentucky, on the little
roadway Boone was opening.</p>

<p>Henderson&rsquo;s party left Fort Watauga
March 20, 1775, and arrived at the infant
Boonesborough April 20. The leader of
the party fortunately kept a record, though
meager, of this notable journey. This precious
yellow diary is preserved by the Wisconsin
Historical Society. It reads:</p>

<p>Colonel Henderson (as the leader of the
Transylvania Colony is best known) arrived
at Boonesborough one day after the outbreak
of the Revolutionary struggle at Lexington
and Concord, and on his own fortieth
birthday.</p>

<p>A clearer glimpse of the fortunes of this
company of pilgrims who followed in
Boone&rsquo;s wake is preserved for us in the
journal kept by William Calk, who was
with Hart&rsquo;s party that Henderson met at
Martin&rsquo;s cabin on the second of April. The
original manuscript is in the possession of
the family of the late Mr. Thomas Calk,
near Mt. Sterling, Kentucky.</p>

<p>The personal statement of Mrs. Elizabeth
Thomas is of interest in this connection.
She was one of Col. Calloway&rsquo;s company
that followed Henderson in September 1775.
This statement is preserved in the library of
the Wisconsin Historical Society and reads:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was born in Virginia on the 4<sup>th</sup> day
of Sept 1764 In Rockbridge county near the
Natural Bridge my father moved on the
North Fork of Holston within 4 or 5 miles
of Abbingdon &amp; remained there two or
three years and in March 1775 we moved
down Holstien near the Big Island, [Long
Island] where we remained until Sept 1775
when Col Calloway and his company came
along going to Kentucky, when my father
William Pogue packed up and came with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
him with our family, Col Boone and with
his wife and family and Col Hugh Mcgary,
Thomas Denton and Richard Hogan were
on the road before us and when we arrived
at Boonesborough the latter part of September
There was only fur [four] or six
cabbins built along on the Bank of the
Kentucky river but not picketted in being
open on two sides.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>This was the great pathway of early
pioneers to Kentucky, and the course of the
marvelous floodtide of immigration which
swept over the mountains in the last three
decades of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The itineraries of early travelers describe
the Wilderness Road in definite terms. One
of the earliest is that given by John Filson,
whose history of Kentucky was published
as early as 1784. It described the route
from Philadelphia to Louisville (eight

<p>Mr. Speed preserves for us the itinerary
with &ldquo;observations and occurrences&rdquo; of
William Brown, the father of Judge Alfred
M. Brown, of Elizabeth town, Kentucky.
&ldquo;It is contained in a small manuscript
book,&rdquo; writes Mr. Speed, &ldquo;which has been
preserved in the family. It is especially
interesting from the fact that immediately
upon his arrival in Kentucky, by the journey
of which he made a complete record,
the Battle of Blue Licks occurred. He
aided in burying the slain, among whom
was his own brother, James Brown.&rdquo; The

<p><i>Observations and Occurrences</i>: Set Out
from Hanover Monday, 27th May, 1782;
arrived at the Block-house about the first
week in July. The road from Hanover to
this place is generally very good; crossing
the Blue Ridge is not bad; there is not
more than a small hill with some winding
to go over. Neither is the Alleghany
Mountain by any means difficult at this
gap. There are one or two high hills about
New River and Fort Chiswell. The ford of
New River is rather bad; therefore we
thought it advisable to cross in the ferry-boat.
This is generally a good-watered
road as far as the Block-house. We waited
hereabouts near two weeks for company,
and then set out for the wilderness with
twelve men and ten guns, this being
Thursday, 18th July. The road from this
until you get over Wallen&rsquo;s Ridge generally
is bad, some part very much so, particularly
about Stock Creek and Stock Creek<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Ridge. It is a very mountainous country
hereabout, but there is some fine land in
the bottoms, near the watercourses, in narrow
slips. It will be but a thin settled
country whenever it is settled. The fords
of Holstein and Clinch are both good in
dry weather, but in a rainy season you are
often obliged to raft over. From them
along down Powell&rsquo;s Valley until you get
to Cumberland Gap is pretty good; this
valley is formed by Cumberland Mountain
on the northwest, and Powell Mountain on
the southeast, and appears to bear from
northeast southwestwardly, and is, I suppose,
about one hundred miles in length,
and from ten to twelve miles in breadth.
The land generally is good, and is an
exceeding well-watered country, as well as
the country on Holstein River, abounding
with fine springs and little brooks. For
about fifty miles, as you travel along the
valley, Cumberland Mountain appears to
be a very high ridge of white rocks, inaccessible
in most places to either man or
beast, and affords a wild, romantic prospect.
The way through the gap is not
very difficult, but from its situation travel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>ers
may be attacked in some places, crossing
the mountain, by the enemy to a very great
disadvantage. From thence until you pass
Rockcastle River there is very little good
road; this tract of country is very mountainous,
and badly watered along the trace,
especially for springs. There is some good
land on the water-courses, and just on this
side Cumberland River appears to be a
good tract, and within a few years I expect
to have a settlement on it. Some parts of
the road are very miry in rainy weather.
The fords of Cumberland and Rockcastle
are both good unless the waters be too
high; after you cross Rockcastle there are
a few high hills, and the rest of the way
tolerable good; the land appears to be
rather weak, chiefly timbered with oak, etc.
The first of the Kentucky waters you touch
upon is the head of Dick&rsquo;s River, just eight
miles from English&rsquo;s. Here we arrived
Thursday, 25th inst., which is just seven
days since we started from the Block-house.
Monday, 29th inst., I got to Harrodsburg,
and saw brother James. The next day we
parted, as he was about setting off on a
journey to Cumberland.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>On Monday, August 19th, Colonel John
Todd, with a party of one hundred and
eighty-two of our men, attacked a body of
Indians, supposed to number six or seven
hundred, at the Blue Lick, and was defeated,
with the loss of sixty-five persons missing
and slain.</p>

<p><i>Officers lost</i>: Colonels&mdash;John Todd and
Stephen Trigg; Majors&mdash;Edward Bulger
and Silas Harlan; Captains&mdash;W. McBride,
John Gordon, Jos. Kincaid, and Clough
Overton; Lieutenants&mdash;W. Givens, and
John Kennedy; Ensign&mdash;John McMurtry.</p>

<p>In this action brother James fell. On
Saturday 24th inst., Colonel Logan, with
four hundred and seventy men, went on
the battle-ground and buried the slain;
found on the field, slain, forty-three men,
missing, twenty-two, in all sixty-five.</p>

<p>I traveled but little about the country.
From English&rsquo;s to Harrodsburg was the
farthest west, and from Logan&rsquo;s Fort to
the Blue Lick the farthest north. Thus far
the land was generally good&mdash;except near
and about the Lick it was very poor and
badly timbered&mdash;generally badly watered,
but pretty well timbered. At Richmond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Ford, on the Kentucky River, the bank a
little below the ford appears to be largely
upward of a hundred feet perpendicular of
rock.</p>

<p>On my return to Hanover I set off from
John Craigs&rsquo; Monday, 23d September, 1782;
left English&rsquo;s Tuesday, 1 o&rsquo;clock, arrived
at the Block-house the Monday evening
following, and kept on the same route
downward chiefly that I traveled out.
Nothing material occurred to me. Got to
Hanover sometime about the last of October
the same year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The foregoing itineraries afford us some
conception of the settlements and &ldquo;improvements&rdquo;
that sprang up along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
winding thoroughfare from Virginia to
Kentucky. The writer has sought with
some care to know more of these&mdash;of the
modes of travel, the entertainment which
was afforded along the road to men and
beasts, and the social relation of the greater
settlements in Virginia and Kentucky to
this thin line of human lives across the
continent. Very little information has
been secured. It is plain that the great
immigration to Kentucky would have been
out of the question had there been no
means of succor and assistance along the
road. There were many who gained their
livelihood as pioneer innkeepers and provisioned
along Boone&rsquo;s Road. Among the
very few of these of whom any record is
left, Captain Joseph Martin is perhaps the
most prominent and most worthy of remembrance.
Martin&rsquo;s &ldquo;cabin&rdquo; or &ldquo;station,&rdquo;
as it is variously termed, occupied a strategic
point in far-famed Powell&rsquo;s Valley,
one hundred and eighty miles west of Inglis
Ferry, twenty miles east of Cumberland Gap
and about one hundred and thirty miles
southeast of Crab Orchard and Boonesborough.
Captain Martin was Virginia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Agent for Indian affairs, and was the most
prominent man in the scattered settlements
in Powell&rsquo;s Valley, where he was living at
the time of the founding of Boonesborough.
Later he made his headquarters at Long
Island in North Carolina. It is plain from
Colonel Henderson&rsquo;s journal that wagons
could proceed along Boone&rsquo;s Road in 1775
no further than Martin&rsquo;s cabin. Here
everything was transferred to the packhorses.
Several letters from Colonel
Henderson to Captain Martin, preserved
by the Wisconsin Historical Society, give
us a glimpse of silent Powell&rsquo;s Valley.
One of them reads:</p>

<p style='text-align: right'>
&ldquo;Boonesborough<br />

<p>On July 20 he wrote again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am sorry to hear that the People in
the valey are distressed for provisions and

to my brother to assist you a little with
Powder.</p>

<p>In December, John Williams wrote Captain
Martin from Boonesborough and his
letter gives us a closer insight into affairs
along Boone&rsquo;s Road:</p>

<p>&ldquo;... With respect to the complaints
of the inhabitants of Powells Valley with
regard to cattle being lodged there, I
should think it altogether unjust than
[that] non-inhabitants should bring in cattle
to destroy and eat up the range of the
inhabitants&rsquo; stock; Yet, Sir, I cannot conceive
that Col. Hart&rsquo;s stopping his stock
there, when on their way here, to recruit
them for their journey, can be the least
infringement. Col. Hart is a proprietor,
&amp; [has] as great a right in the country as
any one man. In the Valley are many
lands yet unentered; and certainly if there
be a right in letting stock into the range,
he has a right equal to any man alive. I
therefore hope you will endeavor to convince
the inhabitants thereof, and that it is
no indulgence to Col. Hart, but a right he
claims, and what I think him justly
entitled to.</p>

<p>I hope to have the pleasure of seeing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>you at Boonesborough the 21<sup>st</sup> instant&mdash;in
the meantime making not the least doubt
but that you will use every justifiable
Method in Keeping up peace and harmony
in the Valley&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>As indicated in the former letter, the
emigrants from the colonies were encroaching
upon the Cherokee lands beyond
the Henderson purchase. Joseph Martin
was under the necessity of protesting to
the Assembly of North Carolina against
settlers from that state pressing beyond
the Henderson lands and settling in the
Cherokee country.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> It is seen by Colonel
Henderson&rsquo;s letter that Boone&rsquo;s Road
marked the most westerly limit to which
pioneers could go with safety. Irresponsible
Cherokees invaded the Henderson
purchase, and equally irresponsible (or
ignorant) whites invaded the Cherokee
country. The difficulty probably lay in not
having a definite, plain boundary line that
he who ran might recognize.</p>

<p>The settlement here in Powell&rsquo;s Valley<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
meant everything to the pioneers of Kentucky.
This is made additionally plain by
the attempt of interested parties to have
Captain Martin&rsquo;s Indian Agency removed
from Long Island to a point on Boone&rsquo;s
Road near Cumberland Gap. In December
1782 William Christian wrote Governor
Harrison from &ldquo;Great [Long] Island,&rdquo;
explaining the dependence of the inhabitants
(undoubtedly both red and white)
upon Martin in time of need. &ldquo;I find,&rdquo;
he wrote, &ldquo;that the party here, consisting
of fifty odd, are living on Col. Martin&rsquo;s
corn. Whenever a family begins to be in
a starving condition, it is very probable
they will push for this place &amp; throw themselves
upon him for bread.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Fourteen days later he wrote from Mahanaim
to &ldquo;Hon. Col. Sampson Matthews&rdquo;
of Richmond; protesting against Virginia&rsquo;s
Indian Agency being kept at Long Island,
North Carolina; and urging that it be
removed to near Cumberland Gap:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Gap is near half way betwixt our
settlements on Holston and Kentucky, and
a post there would be a resting place for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
our poor citizens going back and forward,
and would be a great means of saving the
lives of hundreds of them. For it seldom
happens that Indians will kill people near
where they trade; &amp; it is thereabouts the
most of the mischief on the road has been
done.... I view the change I propose
as of great importance to the frontier of
Washington, [County] to our people journeying
to &amp; from Kentucky, particularly
the poor families moving out....&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>It was, throughout the eighteenth
century, exceedingly dangerous to travel
Boone&rsquo;s Road; and those who journeyed
either way joined together and traveled
in &ldquo;companies.&rdquo; Indeed there was risk
enough for the most daring, in any case;
but a well-armed &ldquo;company&rdquo; of tried
pioneers on Boone&rsquo;s Road was a dangerous
game upon which to prey. It was customary
to advertise the departure of a company
either from Virginia or Kentucky, in local
papers; in order that any desiring to make
the journey might know of the intended
departure. The principal rendezvous in
Kentucky was the frontier settlement of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Crab Orchard. Certain of these advertisements
are extremely interesting; the verbal
changes are significant if closely
read:</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">Notice</p>

<p class="noidt">is hereby given, that a company
will meet at the Crab Orchard, on
Sunday the 4<sup>th</sup> day of May, to go
through the wilderness, and to set
out on the 5<sup>th</sup>. at which time most
of the Delegates to the state convention
will go<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>A large company will meet at
the Crab orchard on sunday the
25<sup>th</sup> of May, in order to make an
early start on Monday the 26<sup>th</sup>

settlement<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>A large company will meet at

Richmond<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">Notice</p>

<p class="noidt">Is hereby given that several gentlemen
propose meeting at the
Crab-orchard on the 4<sup>th</sup>. of June in
perfect readiness to move early the
next morning through the Wilderness<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p class="center">Notice</p>

<p>A large company will meet at
the Crab-Orchard the 19<sup>th</sup>. of November
in order to start the next
day through the Wilderness. As
it is very dangerous on account of
the Indians, it is hoped each person
will go well armed<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p></div>

<p>It appears that unarmed persons sometimes
attached themselves to companies
and relied on others to protect them in
times of danger. One advertisement urged
that everyone should go armed and &ldquo;not
to depend on others to defend them.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The frequency of the departure of such
companies suggests the great amount of
travel on Boone&rsquo;s Road. As early as 1788<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
parties were advertised to leave Crab
Orchard May 5, May 15, May 26, June 4,
and June 16. Nor does it seem that there
was much abatement during the more
inclement (safer?) months; in the fall of the
same year companies were advertised to
depart November 19, December 9, and
December 19. Yet at this season the
Indians were often out waylaying travelers&mdash;driven
no doubt by hunger to deeds
of desperation. The sufferings of such
redskinned marauders have found little
place in history; but they are, nevertheless,
particularly suggestive. One story, which
has not perhaps been told <i>ad nauseam</i>,
is to the point; and would be amusing if it
were not so fatally conclusive. In the
winter of 1787-88 a party on Boone&rsquo;s Road
was attacked by Indians not far from the
Kentucky border. Their horses were
plundered of goods, but the travelers
escaped. Hurrying &ldquo;in&rdquo; to the settlements
a company was raised to make a
pursuit. By their tracks in the snow the
Indians were accurately followed. They
were overtaken at a camp, where they were
drying their blankets, &amp;c., before a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
fire. At the first charge the savages, completely
surprised, took to their heels&mdash;stark
naked. Not satisfied with recovering the
stolen goods the Kentuckians pursued the
fugitives into the mountains. Along the
course they found trees stripped of pieces
of bark, with which the Indians had
attempted to cover their bodies. They
were not overtaken, though some of their
well protected pursuers had their own feet
frost-bitten. The awful fate of the savages
is unquestionable.</p>

<p>Before Richard Henderson arrived in
Kentucky Daniel Boone wrote him: &ldquo;My
advice to you, sir, is to come or send as
soon as possible. Your company is desired
greatly, for the people are very uneasy, but
are willing to stay and venture their lives
with you, and now is the time to flustrate
the intentions of the Indians, and keep
the country whilst we are in it. If we
give way to them now, it will ever be
the case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This letter shows plainly how the best
informed man in Kentucky regarded Henderson&rsquo;s
settlement at Boonesborough.
Henderson&rsquo;s purchase was repudiated by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
both Virginia and North Carolina; but the
Virginia Legislature confirmed Henderson&rsquo;s
sales of land, in so far as they were made
to actual settlers, and not to speculators,
Henderson and his associates were granted
land in lieu of that taken from them. The
Transylvania Company, while looked upon
askance by many who preferred to risk
their tomahawk claim rights to those the
Company granted, exerted as great a moral
influence in the first settlement of Kentucky
as Daniel Boone affirmed it would&mdash;a
greater influence than any other company
before the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>What it meant to the American colonies
to have a brave band of pioneers in Kentucky
at that crucial epoch, is an important
chapter in the history of Boone&rsquo;s Road.</p>

<h3>KENTUCKY IN THE REVOLUTION</h3>


<p>History was fast being made in Kentucky
when the Revolutionary
struggle reached the crisis in 1775
at Concord and Lexington. South of the
Ohio River Virginia&rsquo;s new empire was
filling with the conquerors of the West.
The Mississippi Valley counted a population
of thirteen thousand, three thousand
being the population of New Orleans. St.
Louis, in Spanish possession, was carrying
on a brisk trade with the Indians on the
Missouri. Vincennes, the British port on the
Wabash, had a population of four hundred
whites. Detroit, the metropolis of the
West, numbered fifteen hundred inhabitants,
more than double the number
in the dashing days of Gladwin only a
decade before. The British flag also waved
at Kaskaskia on the Mississippi, and at Sandusky.
This fringe of British forts on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
north was separated from the American
metropolis of the West, Pittsburg, and from
the first fortresses built in Kentucky, by
leagues of forests, dark as when Bouquet
pierced them; and filled with sullen Indian
nations, awed for the time being by
Dunmore&rsquo;s invasion, but silently biding
their time to avenge themselves for the
loss of the meadow lands of Ken-ta-kee.</p>

<p>Such was the condition of affairs when,
in April 1775, the open struggle for independence
of the American colonies was
roughly precipitated at Lexington. It
might seem to the casual observer that the
colonists, who were now hastening by way
of Boone&rsquo;s Wilderness Road into the Virginian
Kentucky, could not feel the intense
jealousy for American interests which was
felt by the patriots in the East. On the
contrary, there is evidence that these first
pioneers into the West had a profound
knowledge of the situation; and a sympathy
for the struggling patriots, which
was enhanced even by the distance which
separated them, and the hardships they
had endured. Not a few of them, too, had
known personally of the plundering British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
officials and the obnoxious taxes. It is the
proud boast of Kentuckians that in the
center of their beautiful Blue Grass country
was erected the first monument to the first
dead of the Revolution. A party of
pioneers heard the news of the Battle of
Lexington while sitting about their camp
fire. Long into the night the rough men
told and retold the news, and before morning
named the new settlement they were
to make, Lexington, in honor of New
England&rsquo;s dead.</p>

<p>It was not at all evident at first what the
war was going to amount to in the West.
Scarcely more was known in the West of the
Revolutionary War than had been known
two decades before of the French and
Indian War. But at the outset it was plain
that there was to be a tremendous struggle
on both sides to gain the allegiance, as
the British desired, of the Indian nations
which lay between the Ohio River and the
Great Lakes. For two years the struggle
in the East went on, engrossing the entire
attention of both parties. During 1776 and
1777 the history of the West is merely the
continuation of the bloody story of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
years which led up to Dunmore&rsquo;s campaign,
like the savage attack on Wheeling, in
September, 1777. Slowly the Indians
forgot Lewis&rsquo;s crushing victory at Point
Pleasant, and their solemn pledges at
Camp Charlotte; and were raiding the
feeble Kentucky posts with undiminished
relish, or giving the Long Knives plenty
of provocation for the barbarities of which
the latter are known to have been guilty.</p>

<p>The opening scene of the Revolutionary
War in the West was the most important
phase of the war in the history of Boone&rsquo;s
Wilderness Road; for at the very outset
the question was decided once for all
whether or not that thin, long, priceless
path to Kentucky through the Watauga settlement
was to be held or lost. If it could
not be held, there was no hope left for the
brave men who had gone to found that
western empire beyond the Cumberland
Mountains. With their line of retreat cut
in two by the southern Indians, they were
left without hope of succor or success: for
the success of their enterprise depended
upon the inspiration their advance gave to
those behind them. None would come if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
the Wautauga settlement did not survive.</p>

<p>The British agents among the Southern
Indians&mdash;the Cherokees, Creeks, Choctaws
and Chickasaws&mdash;precipitated a quick
and early struggle along this historic
pathway by goading the Indians into a
murderous attack upon the Watauga settlement.
The Cherokees who had sold the
Transylvania Company its lands, were the
most easily incited to war, and fifty packhorse
loads of ammunition scattered
through their towns in those deep mountain
valleys where the two Carolinas and
Georgia meet, determined an outburst in
July, 1776. Straight north from them lay
the rude beginnings of civilization on the
headwaters of the Tennessee, and further
&ldquo;in&rdquo; was the frontier line of Virginia. The
headquarters of the Watauga settlement
may be said to have been Fort Watauga,
commanded by the heroes Robertson and
Sevier; here Boone had made the treaty
with the Cherokees for Richard Henderson,
a trifle over a year ago. Eaton&rsquo;s, Evan
Shelby&rsquo;s, John Shelby&rsquo;s, Campbell&rsquo;s, and
the Wommack forts were the important
way stations on this path from Virginia to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Kentucky. Two Indian parties larger than
the others made for Fort Watauga and
Eaton&rsquo;s Station, and the defenders of the
latter post, learning from their scouts that
a formidable array under the notorious
Dragging Canoe was coming, resolved to
give them a hot, unexpected welcome.
Accordingly, on the morning of July twentieth
nearly two hundred brown forms
could have been seen stealing away from
the fort in two thin lines half lost in the
fog toward the open land known as
&ldquo;the Flats&rdquo; near the &ldquo;Long Island&rdquo; of
the Holston. In the march an advance
party of a score of savages was met and put
to flight. No other signs of the enemy
could be discovered and the men started
back to their fort at the end of the day.</p>

<p>Dragging Canoe, not less audacious than
his foes, awaited his time, and when the
whites were marching homeward, came
down upon them, his savages forming a
wedge-shaped line of battle. Instantly the
borderers fell back to the right and left,
and with a desperate quietness awaited the
onslaught. The Indian plan of rushing
the whites off their feet by an overwhelm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>ing
charge failed; the borderers settled
deeper into the ground and met the rush
and dashed the savage line into fragments.
One charge&mdash;and all was over. There
was no recovering from this form of attack
for untrained soldiery, and the assaulting
band instantly broke and fled. This battle
of Long Island Flats was the first of the
series of victories for the Watauga pioneers;
its importance can hardly be measured
today.</p>

<p>Its best fruit was that it brought other
victories to the encouraged Wataugans.
On the same day the other Indian horde
invested and assailed Fort Watauga at
dawn. Only about two score men were at
home to defend a large number of women
and children, but they were fully equal to
the emergency and with a frightful burst
of fire drove back the line of savages which
could just be seen advancing at that hour
when Indians invariably made their
attacks&mdash;the early dawn. Robertson was
senior officer in command, and Sevier his
brave assistant. The latter, having learned
of the Indian uprising, characteristically
wrote a message to the people far away on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the Virginia border to look well to their
homes&mdash;never even asking that assistance
be sent to the much more feeble and vastly
more endangered Watauga settlement on
the Kentucky road.</p>

<p>Elsewhere the border warfare was being
waged with varying fortune; a small band
of Georgian frontiersmen invaded the
Cherokee country<a name="FNanchor_20_21" id="FNanchor_20_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_21" class="fnanchor">[20*]</a> in the hope of capturing
a notorious British agent, Cameron; it
suffered heavily through the faithlessness
of the Cherokees. The whole southern
frontier was aroused, and plans for dashes
into the Cherokee country were made but
could not be forwarded simultaneously.
Yet Cameron and his Tories and Indians
acted in unison and brought sudden desolation
into South Carolina. The force of the
blow was broken by the brave Colonel
Andrew Williamson, who, gathering over
a thousand volunteers near the end of
July began the first important invasion of
the Cherokee country. Near Eseneka, the
Cherokee town, the Carolinians found
Cameron and won a costly victory. After
some internal dissensions the little army
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>got on its mettle and went steadily forward
to wipe out the lower Cherokee towns,
which was completely accomplished by the
middle of August. Scarcity of ammunition,
only, kept Williamson from attacking
the middle towns.</p>

<p>This task fell to the lot of the second
expedition into the Cherokee country.
This was a joint campaign waged by North
and South Carolina, and Virginia, each to
furnish two thousand men. The North
Carolinians under Rutherford were earliest
in the field. This officer with twenty-four
hundred men left the head of the Catawba
and opened &ldquo;Rutherford&rsquo;s Trace&rdquo; leading
to Swananoa Gap in the Blue Ridge and on
to the middle Cherokee towns by way of
Warrior&rsquo;s Ford of French Broad and Mount
Cowee. The middle towns were destroyed,
and, uniting with Williamson, the two
bodies of men swept over the Cherokee
valley towns until &ldquo;all the Cherokee settlements
west of the Appalachians had been
destroyed from the face of the earth,
neither crops nor cattle being left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the Carolinians had been sweeping
into the lower Cherokee country, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Virginia troops had been assembling at the
Long Island of the Holston under their
leader Colonel William Christian. Their
campaign against the Overhill towns was
slowly formed here on the little westward
pathway, and it was not until the first of
October that all the contributions of men
and arms from the settlements between
Fort Watauga and the Virginia frontier
were received. The advance, by way of
Big Island of the Holston, was slow but
determined&mdash;each encampment being made
absolutely secure against surprise. The
Indians, learning of the strength of Christian&rsquo;s
army, knew better than to resist.
They retired without a struggle and the
borderers reached the heart of the Overhill
country on the fifth day of November.
Here they ravaged, burned, and razed to
their hearts&rsquo; content, until a deputation
imploring peace came from the broken
tribes. In this action old Dragging Canoe
would have no part but stole away with a
few followers toward the Chickamauga.
Christian agreed to a treaty which definitely
marked out the boundary line
between the Indians and the whites, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
then returned home leaving a garrison near
the Kentucky path by the Holston. In the
words of Roosevelt, who of all writers has
done this campaign most justice: &ldquo;The
Watauga people and the westerners generally
were the real gainers by the war.
Had the Watauga settlements been destroyed,
they would no longer have covered
the Wilderness Road to Kentucky; and so
Kentucky must perforce have been abandoned.
But the followers of Robertson and
Sevier stood stoutly for their homes; not
one of them fled over the mountains. The
Cherokees had been so roughly handled
that for several years they did not again
go to war as a body; and this not only gave
the settlers a breathing time, but also
enabled them to make themselves so strong
that when the struggle was renewed they
could easily hold their own. The war was
thus another and important link in the chain
of events by which the west was won; and
had any link in the chain snapped during
these early years, the peace of 1783 would
probably have seen the trans-Alleghany
country in the hands of a non-American
power.&rdquo; If the holding of this pathway<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
was of such moment the value of the pathway
is plainly understood.</p>

<p>Turning now to the end of Boone&rsquo;s
Road, it will be necessary to review briefly
the Revolutionary War in the &ldquo;far&rdquo; West;
though in many of the campaigns the road
itself played no part, in a large and genuine
sense it was the pilgrims of Boone&rsquo;s Road
who fought the most important battles of
the Revolution in the West.</p>

<p>Early in the struggle in the West,
far-sighted ones saw signs of the growing
despicable alliance of the savages
to British interests; and before the bloody
year of 1778 opened, it was only a question
of how much England wanted of
the savage allies who were crowded about
their forts along the lakes. It is a
terrible blot on the history of British rule
in America, that when driven to face
the same situation, English officers in the
West used every means of retaliation for
the use of which they so roundly condemned
French officials a quarter of a century
before. American officers employed Indians
as guides and scouts, and were guilty
of provoking inter-tribal war; but they did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
not pay Indians for bringing in British
scalps, or praise them for their murderous
successes and equip them for further
service. As a brave American officer said,
&ldquo;Let this reproach remain on them&rdquo;&mdash;and
the people of the West will never forget
the reproach, nor forgive! They remember,
and always will remember, the burning
words of Washington written more than
ten years after the close of the Revolution:
&ldquo;All the difficulties we encounter with the
Indians, their hostilities, the murder of
helpless women and children along all our
frontiers, results from the conduct of the
agents of Great Britain in this country.&rdquo;
There are today, in hundreds of homes of
descendants of the pioneers in Kentucky,
memories of the inhuman barbarities of
British officers during the Revolution;
these will never be forgotten, and will never
fail to prejudice generations yet unborn.
The reproach will remain on them.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the war, chiefs of the
Indian nations were invited to Pittsburg,
where the nature of the struggle was
explained to them in the following parable:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose a father had a little son whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
he loved and indulged while young, but
growing up to be a youth, began to think
of having some help from him; and making
up a small pack, he bid him carry it for
him. The boy cheerfully takes this pack
up, following his father with it. The
father finding the boy willing and obedient,
continues in this way; and as the boy
grows stronger, so the father makes the
pack in proportion larger; yet as long as
the boy is able to carry the pack, he does
so without grumbling. At length, however,
the boy having arrived at manhood,
while the father is making up the pack for
him, in comes a person of an evil disposition,
and, learning who was to be the
carrier of the pack, advises the father to
make it heavier, for surely the son is able
to carry a larger pack. The father, listening
rather to the bad adviser than consulting
his own judgment and the feelings of
tenderness, follows the advice of the hard-hearted
adviser, and makes up a heavy load
for his son to carry. The son, now grown
up, examining the weight of the load he is
to carry, addresses the father in these
words: &lsquo;Dear Father, this pack is too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
heavy for me to carry, do pray lighten it;
I am willing to do what I can, but am
unable to carry this load.&rsquo; The father&rsquo;s
heart having by this time become hardened,
and the bad adviser calling to him,
&lsquo;Whip him if he disobeys,&rsquo; and he refusing
to carry the pack, the father orders his son
to take up the pack and carry it off or he
will whip him, and already takes up a stick
to beat him. &lsquo;So,&rsquo; says the son, &lsquo;am I to
be served thus for not doing what I am
unable to do? Well, if entreaties avail
nothing with you, Father, and it is to be
decided by blows, whether or not I am
able to carry a pack so heavy, then I have
no other choice left me, but that of resisting
your unreasonable demand by my
strength, and thus by striking each other
learn who is the strongest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Indians were urged to become
neutral in the struggle that was opening.
Impossible as such a course would have
been to men who loved war better than
peace, certain tribes promised to maintain
neutrality. In a few months, however,
most of the nations were in open or secret
alliance with British officers. Only the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
better element of the Delaware nation, led
by Captain White Eyes, became attached to
the American cause. England was always
handicapped in her use of the American
Indian, because of the want of men who
could successfully exert control over him.
Even when the forts of the French in the
West passed into British possession,
Frenchmen were retained in control, since
no Englishman could so well rule the savages
who made the forts their rendezvous.
The beginning of the successful employment
of the Indians against the growing
Virginian empire south of the Ohio, and
against the multiplying cabins and forts of
the Long Knives, may loosely be said to
have begun in the spring of 1778 when
three northern renegades, Simon Girty,
Matthew Elliott, and Alexander McKee,
eluded the continental General Hand at
Pittsburg and took service under Lieutenant-governor
Hamilton at Detroit. Bred
to border warfare, and well known among
the Indians from the Susquehanna to the
Missouri, these three men were the &ldquo;most
effective tools for the purposes of border
warfare&rdquo; that the British could have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
secured. Hamilton immediately began to
plan the invasion of Pennsylvania and the
conquest of Pittsburg. The campaign was
condemned by his superiors in the East,
and was forgotten by its originator&mdash;when
the news of a bold invasion of his own
territory by a Virginian army suddenly
reached his ears.</p>

<p>The Transylvania Company came silently
but suddenly to an end when the Kentuckians
elected George Rogers Clark and
Gabriel John Jones members of the Virginian
assembly, for the assembly erected
the county of Kentucky out of the land
purchased by Henderson at Fort Watauga
in 1775. Upon bringing this about, Clark,
a native of Virginia and a hero of Dunmore&rsquo;s
War, returned to Kentucky nourishing
greater plans. With clear eyes he saw
that the increasing affiliation of Indian and
British interests meant that England, even
though she might be unsuccessful in the
East, could keep up an interminable and
disastrous warfare &ldquo;along the rear of the
colonies,&rdquo; as long as she held forts on the
northern edge of the Black Forest. Clark
sent spies northward, who gained informa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>tion
confirming his suspicions; and then
he hurried eastward, with his bold plan of
conquering the &ldquo;strongholds of British
and Indian barbarity&rdquo;&mdash;Kaskaskia, Vincennes,
and Detroit.</p>

<p>He came at a fortunate time. The
colonies were rejoicing over the first great
victory of the early war, Saratoga. Hope,
everywhere, was high. From Patrick
Henry, Governor of Virginia, Clark
received two orders, one of which was to
attack the British post Kaskaskia. He at
once set out for Pittsburg to raise, in the
West (where both Dunmore and Lewis
raised their armies), troops for the most
brilliant military achievement in western
history. Descending the Ohio to Kentucky,
where he received re&euml;nforcements,
Clark marched silently through the forests&mdash;with
one hundred and thirty-five chosen
men&mdash;to Kaskaskia, which he took in
utter surprise July 4, 1778. &ldquo;Keep on with
your merriment,&rdquo; he said to revelers
whom he surprised at a dance, &ldquo;but remember
you dance under Virginia, not Great
Britain.&rdquo; Clark brought the news of
the alliance recently made between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
France and the United States into the
Illinois country and used it with telling
effect. A French priest at Vincennes
raised a Virginian flag over that fort,
telling the inhabitants and the Indians
that their &ldquo;French Father had come to
life.&rdquo; In October Virginia incorporated
the &ldquo;County of Illinois&rdquo; within her western
empire&mdash;the first portion of the land
north of the Ohio River to come under the
administration of one of the states of the
Union.</p>

<p>Contemporaneously with Clark&rsquo;s stirring
conquest, an expedition was raised at Pittsburg
to march against the Indians in the
neighborhood of the British fort at Sandusky&mdash;possibly
to counteract the rumored
attempt to invade Pennsylvania, by Hamilton
at Detroit. Troops and supplies were
to be assembled at Fort Pitt, where the
famous route of Bouquet was to be followed
toward the lakes. The expedition was put
in charge of General Lachlan McIntosh.
Distressing delays made the half-hearted
Indians who were to guide the army,
chafe; and McIntosh started before his
stores arrived, fearing that longer delay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
would alienate his friendly Indians, among
whom was the Delaware, White Eyes, now
turned from a neutral course. At the
mouth of the Beaver River McIntosh built
the fort which bears his name&mdash;the first
fort built by the Americans on the northern
side of the Ohio. Advancing westward
over Bouquet&rsquo;s tri-trail track with twelve
hundred men, he reached the Muskingum
(Tuscarawas) River in fourteen days,
arriving November 19, 1778, where he
erected Fort Laurens.</p>

<p>But Lieutenant-governor Hamilton, learning
of Clark&rsquo;s seizure of Kaskaskia and
the treachery of the fickle inhabitants of
Vincennes, set about to reconquer Illinois.
Departing from Detroit on a beautiful
October day, the expedition descended the
Detroit River and entered the Maumee.
The weather changed and it was seventy-one
days before the American Captain
Helm at Vincennes surrendered his
wretched fort and became a prisoner of
war. Hamilton was unable to push on to
Kaskaskia because of the lack of provisions,
and sat down to watch the winter out
where he was. Thus the spectacular year<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
1778 closed&mdash;Clark at Kaskaskia, watching
his antagonist feasting at Vincennes; McIntosh&rsquo;s
little guard at Fort Laurens
undergoing continual harassing and siege.
In the East the evacuation of Philadelphia,
the battle of Monmouth, and the terrible
Wyoming massacre were the events of the
year.</p>

<p>The year 1779 was to see as brilliant an
achievement in the West, as the East was
to see in the capture of Stony Point. This
was the recapture of Vincennes by Clark.
Joined by an experienced adventurer, Colonel
Francis Vigo, formerly of the Spanish
service, Clark was persuaded that he must
capture Hamilton or Hamilton would capture
him. Accordingly, on the fifth of
February, Clark set out for Vincennes with
one hundred and seventy trusty men. In
twelve days they reached the Embarras
River, which was crossed on the twenty-first
with great bravery, the men wading in
water to their shoulders. On the twenty-fifth,
Hamilton, the most surprised man in
the world, was compelled to surrender.
Within two weeks he was on his way to
Virginia; where, being found guilty of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
buying Virginian scalps from the Indians,
he was imprisoned, but was exchanged the
year following.</p>

<p>In July, while returning from New
Orleans with supplies; Colonel Rogers and
his party of Kentuckians were overwhelmed
by Indians, under Girty and Elliott, on the
Ohio River. In a terrible running battle
sixty Kentuckians were killed. The sad
news spread quickly through Kentucky and
a thousand tongues called loudly for
revenge. In response Major Bowman led
three hundred volunteers up the Scioto
Valley and attacked the Shawanese capital.
There was bungling somewhere and a
retreat was ordered before victory was
achieved.</p>

<p>During this summer the conqueror of
Illinois expected to complete his triumph
by the capture of Detroit. A messenger
from Thomas Jefferson, Governor of Virginia,
brought tidings that troops for this
expedition would be forthcoming from
Virginia and Kentucky, and rendezvous at
Vincennes in July. When the time came,
Clark found only a few soldiers from Kentucky
and none at all from Virginia. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Detroit expedition fell through because of
Virginia&rsquo;s poverty in money and in men;
though artillery, ammunition, and tools
had been secured for the campaign from
Fort Pitt, at Washington&rsquo;s command. But
with masterly foresight Governor Jefferson
secured the establishment of a fort on the
Mississippi River in the Illinois country.
During this summer the little garrison
which General McIntosh left buried in the
Black Forest at Fort Laurens fled back over
the trail to Pittsburg. Nowhere north
of the Ohio were the scenes frequently
enacted in Kentucky reproduced so vividly
as at little Fort Laurens, on the upper
Muskingum. At one time fourteen of the
garrison were decoyed and slaughtered.
At another time an army numbering seven
hundred warriors invested the little half-forgotten
fortress and its intrepid defenders.
A slight embankment may be seen today
near Bolivar, Ohio, which marks one side of
the first fort erected in what is now Ohio,
those near the lake shore excepted. Thus
closed the year 1779: Clark again in possession
of Vincennes, as well as Kaskaskia
and Cahokia, but disappointed in the fail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>ure
of the Detroit expedition; Hamilton
languishing in a Virginia dungeon, twelve
hundred miles from his capital&mdash;Fort Detroit;
Fort Laurens abandoned, and the
Kentucky country covered with gloom over
Rogers&rsquo;s terrible loss and Bowman&rsquo;s inglorious
retreat from the valley of the
Scioto. On the other hand, the East was
glorying in Mad Anthony Wayne&rsquo;s capture
of Stony Point, Sullivan&rsquo;s rebuke to the
Indians, and Paul Jones&rsquo;s electrifying
victory on the sea.</p>

<p>In 1780 four expeditions set forth, all of
them singular in character, and noteworthy.
The year before, 1779, Spain had
declared war upon England. The new
commander at Detroit took immediate
occasion to regain control of the Mississippi
by attacking the Spanish town of St.
Louis. This expedition, under Captain
Sinclair, descended the Mississippi from
Prairie du Chien. The attack was not
successful, but six whites were killed and
eighteen taken prisoner.</p>

<p>At the time of Bowman&rsquo;s expedition
against the Shawanese, in the preceding
year a British officer, Colonel Bird, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
assembled a noteworthy array at Sandusky
preparatory to the invasion of Kentucky.
News of the Kentucky raid up the Scioto
Valley set Bird&rsquo;s Indians to &ldquo;cooking and
counselling&rdquo; again, instead of acting.
This year Bird&rsquo;s invasion materialized, and
the fate of the Kentucky settlements
trembled in the balance. The invading
army of six hundred Indians and Canadians
was armed with two pieces of artillery.
There is little doubt that this army could
have battered down every &ldquo;station&rdquo; in
Kentucky and swept victoriously through
the new settlements. Ruddles&rsquo;s station on
the Licking was first menaced, and surrendered
quickly. Martin&rsquo;s fort also capitulated.
But here Bird paused in his conquest
and withdrew northward, the barbarity of
the Indian allies, for once at least, shocking
a British commander. The real secret of
the abrupt retreat lay no doubt in the fact
that the increasing immigration had brought
such vast numbers of people into Kentucky
that Bird dared not penetrate further into
the land for fear of a surprise. The gross
carelessness of the newly arrived inhabitants,
in not taking the precaution to build<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
proper defenses against the Indians, undoubtedly
appeared to the British commander
as a sign of strength and fortitude
which he did not have the courage to put
to the test. As a matter of fact, he could
probably have annihilated every settlement
between the Ohio River and Cumberland
Gap.</p>

<p>In retaliation Kentucky sent an immense
army north of the Ohio, a thousand men
volunteering under Clark, the hero of
Vincennes. A large Indian army was
routed near the Shawanese town Pickaway.
Many towns with standing crops were
burned. A similar expedition from Pittsburg
under General Brodhead burned crops
and villages on the upper Muskingum.</p>

<p>In return for the attack on St. Louis,
the Spanish commander at that point sent
an expedition against the deserted British
post of St. Joseph. Upon declaring war
against England in the previous year, Spain
had occupied Natchez, Baton Rouge, and
Mobile, which, with St. Louis, gave her
command of the Mississippi. But his
Catholic Majesty was building other Spanish
castles in America. He desired the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
conquest of the British northwest, to offset
the British capture of Gibraltar. This
&ldquo;capture&rdquo; of St. Joseph led to an amusing
but ominous claim on the part of Spain at
the Treaty of Paris: when, with it for a
pretext, the Spanish Crown claimed all
lands west of a line drawn from St. Joseph
southward through what is now Ohio, Kentucky,
Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, and
Mississippi. The Mississippi River boundary
was, however, stoutly contended for
and obtained by the American commissioners.</p>

<p>In this year the first &ldquo;gunboat&rdquo; to ply
western waters was built under direction
of Brigadier-general Clark. It was a galley
armed with light artillery. This queer-looking
craft soon fell into disuse, though
it became a terror to the Indians who continually
infested the lower Ohio. It was
relished little better by the militia, who
disliked service on water. But it stands as
a typical illustration of the enterprise and
devotion of the &ldquo;Father of Kentucky&rdquo; to
the cause for which he had done so much.</p>

<p>The year following, 1781, saw the termination
of the Revolution in the East,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
when Cornwallis&rsquo;s army marched down the
files of French and American troops at
Yorktown to the melancholy tune &ldquo;The
World&rsquo;s Turned Upside Down.&rdquo; The
Treaty of Paris was not signed until 1783,
and in the meantime the bloodiest year of
all the war in the West, 1782, was adding
its horrors to all that had gone before.
While the East was rejoicing, the central
West saw the terrible massacre of Gnadenhutten&mdash;the
more terrible because committed
by white men themselves.</p>

<p>In May, 1782, the atrocities of the savages
(encouraged by the British) along the
Pennsylvanian and Virginian border were
becoming unbearable, and an expedition
was raised in the Monongahela country to
penetrate to the Indian-infested country on
the Sandusky River. Volunteers, four
hundred in number, all mounted, rendezvoused
at the Ohio near Mingo Bottom;
they elected as commander Colonel William
Crawford, an experienced officer of the
Revolutionary War, following Washington
faithfully through the hard Long Island
and Delaware campaigns. Crawford struck
straight through the forests, even avoiding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Indian trails, at first, in the hope of taking
his foe utterly by surprise. But his wily
foe completely outwitted him and the
Indians and British knew well each day&rsquo;s
progress. The battle was fought in a
prairie land near the Sandusky River in
what is now Crawford County, Ohio, and
though not a victory for either side, an
American retreat was ordered during the
night following. Colonel Crawford was
captured, among others, and suffered a
terrible death at the stake, perhaps the saddest
single atrocity committed by the redman
in western history. This gray-haired
veteran of the Revolution gave his life to
appease the Indians for a massacre of
Christian Indians perpetrated by savage
borderers from the Monongahela country
the year previous.</p>

<p>Kentucky had witnessed minor activities
of the savages during the spring. In
August a grand Indian army assembled on
the lower Scioto for the purpose of invading
Kentucky. The assembly was
harangued by Simon Girty, and moved
southward and invaded Bryant&rsquo;s Station,
one of the strongest forts in Kentucky.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
After a terrible day, during which re-enforcements
kept arriving, only to be
compelled to fight their way into the fort
or flee, Girty attempted to secure capitulation.
Outwitted, the renegade resorted to
a stratagem, as cunningly devised as it was
terribly successful. In the night the entire
Indian army vanished as if panic-stricken.
Meat was left upon the spits. Garments
lay strewn about the encampment and
along the route of the fugitive army. The
more experienced of the border army,
which was soon in full cry on the trail,
scented the deception; but the headstrong
hurried onward in hope of revenge. At
the crossing of the Licking, near the lower
Blue Licks, the Indian ambush received the
witless pursuers with a frightful burst of
flame, and the battle of Blue Licks became
a running fire, a headlong rout and
massacre.</p>

<p>A thousand men joined Clark for a retaliatory
invasion of the north, and the usual
destruction of villages and crops was accomplished.
This may be considered the last
military event in the Revolutionary War
in the West.</p>

<h3>AT THE END OF BOONE&rsquo;S ROAD</h3>


<p>On the nineteenth of April, 1775, the
rumble of the running fire at Lexington
and Concord told that the
farmers of New England had at last precipitated
the struggle which had been impending
for a full generation. It was a roar
that, truly, was &ldquo;heard round the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One day later, April 20, 1775, Colonel
Henderson and his fellow-pioneers of the
Transylvania Company reached Boonesborough;
there they were joyfully received
by a running fire of five and twenty muskets
discharged by Boone&rsquo;s vanguard, which had
preceded them to cut the road. If the
musket-shot behind the New England
stone walls was heard round the world, the
rattle of that score of muskets in distant
Kentucky was heard around a continent.
The former uttered a hoarse defiance to
tyrants&mdash;a cry to God for liberty; what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
was the faint roar which echoed back a
thousand mountain miles from Kentucky
but an answer to that cry? an assurance
that &ldquo;to him that hath shall be given?&rdquo;
There is something divinely significant to
me in the coincidence of the opening shock
of the Revolution, and the arrival in Kentucky
of the first considerable body of
determined, reputable men.</p>

<p>The story of the Revolutionary War in
the West has been told in preceding pages,
as the merest record of fact. It is unnecessary
to state that it was the most important
conflict ever waged there, and it is equally
trite to observe that the struggle centered
around Kentucky. Boone&rsquo;s Road had made
possible the sudden movement of population
westward, and this pioneer host immediately
drew upon itself the enemies that
otherwise would have scourged the frontiers
of New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and
North Carolina. The first and principal
portion of the Kentucky pioneers&mdash;those
who fought the Revolutionary battles&mdash;entered
Kentucky by the Cumberland Gap
route. James Lane Allen writes: &ldquo;That
area [Kentucky] has somewhat the shape<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
of an enormous flat foot, with a disjointed
big toe, a roughly hacked-off ankle, and a
missing heel. The sole of this huge foot
rests solidly on Tennessee, the Ohio River
trickles across the ankle and over the top,
the big toe is washed entirely off by the Tennessee
River, and the long-missing heel is
to be found in Virginia, never having been
ceded by that State. Between the Kentucky
foot and the Virginia heel is piled up
this immense, bony, grisly mass of the
Cumberland Mountain, extending some
three hundred miles northeast and southwest.
It was through this heel that Kentucky
had to be peopled. The thin, half-starved,
weary line of pioneer civilizers had
to penetrate it, and climb this obstructing
mountain wall, as a line of traveling ants
might climb the wall of a castle. In this
case only the strongest of the ants&mdash;the
strongest in body, the strongest in will&mdash;succeeded
in getting over and establishing
their colony in the country far beyond.
Luckily there was an enormous depression
in the wall, or they might never have
scaled it. During about half a century this
depression was the difficult, exhausting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
entrance-point through which the State
received the largest part of its people, the
furniture of their homes, and the implements
of their civilization; so that from
the very outset that people represented the
most striking instance of a survival of the
fittest that may be observed in the founding
of any American commonwealth. The
feeblest of the ants could not climb the
wall; the idlest of them would not.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_21_22" id="FNanchor_21_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_22" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Mr.
Speed agrees wholly in this opinion:
&ldquo;The settlers came in ... increasing
numbers.... A very large proportion
came over the Wilderness Road.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_22_23" id="FNanchor_22_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_23" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> In
the early days river travel was not practicable.
During the Revolutionary War
and for some time thereafter travel down
the Ohio River was dangerous, both because
of the hostility of the savages and because
of the condition of the river. In earlier
days the journey from the Ohio into the
populated parts of Kentucky was a great
hardship. The story of one who emigrated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
to Kentucky by way of the Ohio shows
plainly why many preferred the longer
land route by way of Cumberland Gap.
The following is from an autobiographical
statement made by Spencer Record, preserved
by the Wisconsin Historical Society:</p>

<p>&ldquo;About the Twentieth of November
(1783) we embarked on the Monongahela in
our boat, in company with Kiser, I having
with me four head of horses and some
cattle. We landed at the mouth of Limestone
Creek, but there was then, no settlement
there. We made search for a road,
but found none. There was indeed a
buffalo road, that crossed Limestone Creek
a few miles above its mouth, and passing
May&rsquo;s lick about twelve miles from Limestone,
went on to the Lower Blue Lick on
Licking river, and thence to Bryant&rsquo;s station:
but as we knew nothing of it, we
went on, and landed at the mouth of Licking
river, on the twenty ninth of the
month.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next day, we loaded periogue, and
a canoe, and set off up Licking, sometimes
wading and pulling our periogue and canoe
over the ripples. After working hard for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
four days, we landed, hid our property
(which was whiskey and our farming utensils)
in the woods, and returned to the Ohio,
which by this time had taken a rapid rise
and backed up Licking, so that we took
Kiser&rsquo;s boat up, as far as we had taken our
property and unloaded her. We left on
the bank of Licking, a new wagon and
some kettles. Leaving our property to
help Kiser, we packed up and set off up
Licking, and travelled some days; but
making poor progress, and snow beginning
to fall, with no cane in that part of the
country, for our horses and cattle, we left
Kiser and set off to hunt for cane. He
sent his stock with us, in care of Henry
Fry, who had come down in his boat with
cattle for his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we came to the fork of Licking
we found a wagon road cut out, that led up
the South fork. This road had been cut
by Colonel Bird, a British officer, who had
ascended Licking in keel boats, with six
hundred Canadians and Indians. They
were several days in cutting out this road
which led to Riddle&rsquo;s fort, which stood on
the east side of Licking, three miles below<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
the junction of Hinkston&rsquo;s and Stoner&rsquo;s
fork, yet our people knew nothing of it,
till they were summoned to surrender....
We took the road and went on,
the snow being about half leg deep. Early
in the morning, about three miles from
Riddle&rsquo;s fort, we came to three families
encamped. They had landed at Limestone
but finding no road, they wandered through
the woods, crossed Licking, and happening
to find the road, took it.... We went
on to the fort, where we found plenty of
cane. The next morning, John Finch and
myself set off to try to find Lexington, and
left the horses and cattle ... as there
was no road, we took up Will creek, and
towards the head of it we met some hunters,
who lived on the south side of Kentucky
river who gave us directions how to find a
hunting trace, that led to Bryant&rsquo;s station....
We went on, found the trace,
and arrived at Bryant&rsquo;s station.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_23_24" id="FNanchor_23_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_24" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Adding to the difficulties of land travel
the dangers of the river tide, the difficulty
of securing boats, and their great cost, it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
little wonder that emigrants from Virginia
preferred the long but better-known land
route, through Powell&rsquo;s Valley and Cumberland
Gap to the Braddock Road and the
Ohio River. At a later date, however, the
difficulties of river passage were materially
decreased and the Ohio became the great
outward emigrant route.</p>

<p>But for the return traffic from Kentucky
to Virginia, there was no comparison
between the ease of the land route and the
water route. Mr. Speed affirms that the
road through Cumberland Gap &ldquo;was the
only practicable route for all return
travel.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_24_25" id="FNanchor_24_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_25" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Of course for a long period
there were no exports from Kentucky, as
hardly enough could be raised to feed the
multitude of immigrants; but when at last
Kentucky strode to the front with its great
harvests of wheat and tobacco, the Mississippi
and Ohio ports received them.</p>

<p>The East received comparatively little
benefit, in a commercial way, from Boone&rsquo;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Road; but in the earliest days that slight
track furnished a moral support that can
hardly be exaggerated. The vast population
that surged westward over it was a
mighty barrier which protected the rear of
the colonies from the savages, until savage
warfare was at an end. Though the frontiers
of New York, Pennsylvania, and
Virginia suffered greatly during the Revolution,
it was Kentucky that was the thorn
in the side of the British; Kentucky drew
the fire of both British and Indians which
otherwise would have desolated the rear
of the eastern colonies, and necessitated a
greater number of men than could possibly
have been maintained there. It was not at
Fort Pitt that the British were constantly
striking, but at the Kentucky &ldquo;stations;&rdquo;
it was not up the Allegheny or Monongahela
that Colonel Burd pushed his keel
boats, but up the Licking. This fact is
splendidly urged by Col. John Floyd, in a
letter to the governor of Virginia written
on the sixth of October, 1781, in a plea for
assistance in maintaining the Kentucky
settlements:</p>

<p>&ldquo;... A great deal more might be said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
concerning the dangerous situation of these
counties, but I have not been informed
whether Government think it absolutely
necessary for the advantage of the community
at large to defend this country [Kentucky]
at so considerable expense as must
be incurred thereby; and I therefore beg
leave to offer your Excellency one or two
reasons why it may be of advantage to
defend the Kentucky country. It is now
beyond a doubt, that the attention of at
last [least] 6000 savage warriors is fixed on
this spot, and who will not disturb any
other part of the Continent as long as we
maintain our ground. But, on the contrary,
as soon as this country is laid waste, they
will immediately fall upon the inhabitants
of Washington, Montgomery, Greenbriar,
&amp;c&mdash;in short, from South Carolina to Pennsylvania.
I believe all the counties on the
west side of the Blue Ridge were kept for
many years penned up in forts by the
Shawanese, Mingoes, Delawares &amp; a few
of their adherents; if so what will be the
consequence when at least fifteen powerful
Nations are united and combined with those
above mentioned against about twelve hun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>dred
militia dispersed over three very
extensive counties. Those nations have
absolutely been kept off your back settlements
by the inhabitants of Kentucky.
Two or three thousand men in this country
would be sufficient to defend it, and effectually
secure the back settlements on New
River &amp; its waters, as well as those high
up James River &amp; Roanoake.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_25_26" id="FNanchor_25_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_26" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>In addition to conferring the inestimable
advantage of defending the frontiers of the
colonies, the early settlement and the holding
of Kentucky insured American possession
of the Middle West; this meant
everything to the East&mdash;for the steady,
logical expansion of the nation was the one
hope of the country when independence
was secured. Upon the Americanization
of the Mississippi Valley depended the
safety of the eastern colonies, and their
commercial and political welfare. It meant
very much to the East that a strong colony
was holding its own on the Ohio and
Mississippi during the hours when the
Revolutionary struggle was in progress;
and it meant even more to the East that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
upon the conclusion of that struggle, thousands
whose future seemed as black as the
forests of the West could immediately
emigrate thither and begin life anew. But
for the Virginians and Kentuckians along
the Ohio it is almost certain that Great
Britain would have divided the eastern half
of this continent with the triumphant revolutionists.
For the few posts along the
lakes that she did hold there was a spirited
wrangle for twenty years, until they were
at last handed over to the United States.
Boone did not blaze his road one day too
soon, and the hand of divine Providence
is not shown more plainly in our national
history than by the critical timeliness with
which these pioneers were ushered into the
meadow lands of Ken-ta-kee. The onslaughts
of Shawanese and Wyandot did not
overwhelm them; nor were they daunted by
the plotting of desperate British officers,
who spread ruin and desolation along the
flank and rear of the fighting colonies.</p>

<p>Again, this earliest population in the
immediate valley of the Mississippi had a
powerful influence on the attitude of the
United States toward the powers that held<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
the Mississippi. Had it not been for a
Kentucky in embryo in 1775-82, it is
unquestionable that the confused story of
the possession of that great river valley
would have been worse confounded. The
whirl of politics in Kentucky during the
four decades after the Revolutionary War
daunts even the student of modern Kentucky
politics; and of one thing we may
rest assured&mdash;had the State possessed a
little less of the sober sense that came from
Virginia through Cumberland Gap, it is
certain the story of those wild days would
not be as readable to modern Kentuckians
as it is. It was more than fortunate for the
young Republic that at the close of the
Revolution there was a goodly population
of expatriated Virginians and North Carolinians
on the Mississippi, ready to press
its claims there.</p>

<p>Thus we may briefly suggest the benefits
which the older colonies received from the
earliest settlers in Kentucky&mdash;and but for
Boone&rsquo;s Road made by the Transylvania
Company, it is exceedingly doubtful, as
Boone wrote, whether the settlement of
Kentucky would have been successfully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
inaugurated as early as 1774. At any rate
Boone&rsquo;s Road brought into Kentucky thousands
of pioneers who probably would have
refused to move westward by the Ohio
River route.</p>

<p>As for the benefit Kentucky itself received
from Boone&rsquo;s Road, that is self-evident.
Taking everything into consideration, no
distinct movement of population in
America, before or since, can compare in
magnitude with the burst of immigration
through Cumberland Gap between 1775
and 1790. Never on this continent was a
population of seventy thousand people
located, within fifteen years of the day the
first cabins were erected, at an equal
distance from the existing frontier line.
It is difficult to frame the facts of this
remarkable phenomenon in language that
will convey the full meaning. If the brave
pioneers from Connecticut who founded the
Northwest Territory at Marietta, Ohio, in
1788, had gone on to Kentucky, they would
have found themselves, within twelve
years, in as populous a state as that they
left in New England. The Stanwix Treaty
and Boone&rsquo;s Road largely answer the ques<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>tion
why Kentucky contained more than
one-half as many inhabitants as Massachusetts,
twenty-five years after its first settlement
was made; and why it was admitted
into the Union four years before Tennessee,
ten years before Ohio, twenty-four years
before Indiana, twenty-six years before
Illinois (bounded by the Ohio and Mississippi
and Lake Michigan), and twenty-eight
years before Maine. Between 1790 and
1800 the population of Kentucky jumped
from 70,000 to 220,000, only one-third less
than proud Maryland, and five times that
of Ohio. In the census of 1790 Kentucky
stood fourteenth in a grouping of sixteen
states and territories, while in 1800 it stood
ninth. In 1790 it exceeded the population
of Rhode Island, Delaware and Tennessee.
In 1800 it exceeded New Jersey, New
Hampshire, Georgia, Vermont, Maine,
Tennessee, Rhode Island, and Delaware.
In this year it had one hundred and sixty
thousand more inhabitants than Indiana
Territory, Mississippi Territory, and Ohio
Territory combined. In the decade mentioned,
New York State increased in population
two hundred and fifty thousand;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
far-away Kentucky increased one hundred
and forty-seven thousand.</p>

<p>But the West as a whole was benefited
by Boone&rsquo;s Road. The part played by this
earliest population of Kentucky in the
development of the contiguous states&mdash;Ohio,
Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri&mdash;has
never been emphasized sufficiently. No
Ohio historian has given sufficient attention
to the part played by Kentuckians in the
conquest of that area of territory. The
struggle between the Kentuckians and the
Ohio Indians has been outlined. The
former fought for and saved to the Union
the great territory south of the Ohio; and
then left their smoking cabins and threw
themselves ever and anon across the Ohio,
upon the Indian settlements between that
river and the Great Lakes. Where is even
the Kentucky historian who has done his
state justice in telling the story of Kentucky&rsquo;s
conquest of Ohio and Indiana? Of
the brilliant operations of Clark in Illinois
we know very much, and the part played
by the Kentuckians on the Mississippi and
Illinois has frequently been made plain.
But a singular misconception of the nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
of Indian warfare has robbed the heroes of
old Kentucky of much honor due them.
Judged by ordinary military standards, the
numerous invasions of Ohio and Indiana
by Kentuckians amounted to little. Such
was not the real case, many times. The
Indians could ever retreat helter-skelter
into the forests, avoiding more than a mere
skirmish with the advancing pioneers. But
they could not take their crops&mdash;and the
destruction of one slight maize crop meant
more to the invading army than the killing
of many savages. The killing of the
Indians did nothing but aggravate hostilities
and long delay the end of the conflict.
On the other hand, slaying redskins became
the passion of the whites, and it is probable
that many of their expeditions seemed
failures if blood was not spilt. But their
very presence in the Indian land and the
destruction of the grain fields was more to
their purpose, could they only have realized
it. The Indians were then compelled to
live largely on game, and as this grew
more scarce each year the simple problem
of obtaining subsistence became serious.
The hunters were compelled to go further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
and further into the forest, and the tribes
followed them. By doing nothing more
than burning the harvest fields and ruining
the important springs, the whites were
slowly but surely conquering the trans-Ohio
country.<a name="FNanchor_26_27" id="FNanchor_26_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_27" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> By such a process one river
valley after another was deserted, until,
when the first legalized settlement was
made in Ohio&mdash;at Marietta, in 1788&mdash;the
Muskingum, Scioto and Miami valleys were
practically deserted by redskins. Little as
the Indians relished the new settlement at
Marietta, they paid practically no attention
to it but kept their eyes on the populated
valleys of Kentucky, where their enemies
of so many years&rsquo; standing had settled,
held their own, and then carried fire and
sword northward. In October 1788 Governor
Arthur St. Clair wrote the Hon. Mr.
Brown of Danville, Kentucky, to give
warning of the Indian war that seemed
imminent; &ldquo;The stroke, if it falls at all,
will probably fall upon your country,&rdquo; he
wrote.<a name="FNanchor_27_28" id="FNanchor_27_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_28" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> And the Indian War of 1790 was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
precipitated because of Indian marauds
along the Kentucky border&mdash;not because
of attacks upon the settlements along the
upper Ohio. The Kentuckians had played
a pre&euml;minent part in driving the Indians
back to the head of the Wabash and the
mouth of the Maumee, in the two decades
preceding the Indian War which opened in
1790, and during that war they were to the
American armies what the English were to
the allies at Waterloo. Local histories and
local historians have created the impression
that Ohio was conquered largely by
Ohioans. Nothing could be more misleading.</p>

<p>Far-reaching as the influence of the little
roadway through Cumberland Gap has
been, its actual history is of little interest
or importance. Perhaps none of our ancient
roads has done so much for society in
proportion to the attention paid to it. Any
adjective ever applied to a roadway, if it
were of a derogatory character, might have
been fitly applied to portions of this old
track which played an important part in
giving birth to the first and most important
settlement in the West. During the few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
important years of its existence Boone&rsquo;s
Road was only what Boone made it&mdash;a
blazed foot-path westward. It was but the
merest foot-path from 1774 to 1792, while
thousands floundered over its uncertain
track to lay the rude foundations of civilization
in the land to which it led. &ldquo;There
are roads that make a man lose faith,&rdquo;
writes Mr. Allen; &ldquo;It is known that the
more pious companies [of pioneers] as they
traveled along, would now and then give
up in despair, sit down, raise a hymn, and
have prayers said before they could go
farther.&rdquo; There was probably not a more
desperate pioneer road in America than
this. The mountains to be crossed, the
rivers and swamps the traveler encountered,
were as difficult to overcome as any on
Braddock&rsquo;s Road; and Boone&rsquo;s Road was
very much longer, even if measured from
its technical starting-point&mdash;the Watauga
settlement.</p>

<p>As early as 1779 the Virginia Assembly
took up the subject of a western highway,
and commissioners were appointed to
explore the region on both sides of the
mountains, to choose a course for a road<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>way,
clear and open the route, and render
a report upon the advisability of making a
wagon road. Yet no improvement followed.
The narrow path&mdash;rough, treacherous,
almost impassable&mdash;remained the
only course. A vivid description of what
a journey over it meant in this year, 1779,
has been left us by Chief-justice Robertson
in an address given at Camp Madison,
Franklin County, Kentucky, half a century
ago:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This beneficent enactment [the land
law] brought to the country during the fall
and winter of that year an unexampled tide
of emigrants, who, exchanging all the comforts
of their native society and homes for
settlements for themselves and their children
here, came like pilgrims to a wilderness
to be made secure by their arms and
habitable by the toil of their lives.
Through privations incredible and perils
thick, thousands of men, women, and children
came in successive caravans, forming
continuous streams of human beings, horses,
cattle, and other domestic animals, all
moving onward along a lonely and houseless
path to a wild and cheerless land. Cast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
your eyes back on that long procession of
missionaries in the cause of civilization;
behold the men on foot with their trusty
guns on their shoulders, driving stock and
leading packhorses; and the women, some
walking with pails on their heads, others
riding with children in their laps, and other
children swung in baskets on horses,
fastened to the tails of others going before;
see them encamped at night expecting to
be massacred by Indians; behold them in
the month of December, in that ever
memorable season of unprecedented cold
called the &lsquo;hard winter,&rsquo; traveling two or
three miles a day, frequently in danger of
being frozen or killed by the falling of
horses on the icy and almost impassable
trace, and subsisting on stinted allowances
of stale bread and meat; but now lastly
look at them at the destined fort, perhaps
on the eve of merry Christmas, when met
by the hearty welcome of friends who had
come before, and cheered by fresh buffalo
meat and parched corn, they rejoice at their
deliverance, and resolve to be contented
with their lot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is no vision of the imagination, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
is but an imperfect description of the pilgrimage
of my own father and mother, and
of many others who settled in Kentucky in
December, 1779.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not until 1792 was the mountain route
improved. &ldquo;In that year,&rdquo; writes Mr.
Speed, &ldquo;according to an account-book
recently found among the Henry Innis
Papers, by Colonel John Mason Brown ...
a scheme was projected for the clearing
and improvement of the Wilderness Road,
under the direction of Colonel John Logan
and James Knox. It was a private enterprise
altogether; the subscribers to it are

<p>&ldquo;Besides these, it appears from a note
in the memorandum book there were other
subscribers. Among the Innis papers I
have found the following paper:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Colonel John Logan and Colonel James
Knox, having consented to act as commissioners
to direct and supervise the
making and opening a road from the Crab
Orchard to Powell&rsquo;s Valley, provided funds
to defray the necessary expenses shall be
procured, we, the subscribers, do therefore

<p>&ldquo;The money subscribed was disbursed
by Harry Innis. Men were employed as
&lsquo;road cutters,&rsquo; as &lsquo;surveyors,&rsquo; to &lsquo;carry
provisions,&rsquo; to &lsquo;grind corn,&rsquo; and &lsquo;collect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
bacon.&rsquo; The pay was two shillings sixpence
per day, and the work extended over
twenty-two days in the summer of 1792.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_28_29" id="FNanchor_28_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_29" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The Kentucky legislature passed an act
in 1793, which provided a guard for pilgrims
on the Wilderness Road; in 1794 an
act was passed for the clearing of the
Boonesborough fork of the road, from Rockcastle
Creek to the Kentucky River. In
1795 the legislature passed an act to make
the Wilderness Road a &ldquo;wagon road&rdquo;
thirty feet wide from near Crab Orchard
to Cumberland Gap. Proposals being
advertised for, the aged Daniel Boone
addressed Governor Isaac Shelby the following
letter:</p>

<p style='text-align: right'>feburey the 11th 1796</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir</p>

<p>after my Best Respts to your Excelancy
and famyly I wish to inform you that I
have sum intention of undertaking this
New Rode that is to be Cut through the
Wilderness and I think My Self intiteled
to the ofer of the Bisness as I first Marked
out that Rode in March 1775 and Never
Re&rsquo;d anything for my trubel and Sepose I
am No Statesman I am a Woodsman and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
think My Self as Capable of Marking and
Cutting that Rode as any other man Sir if
you think with Me I would thank you to
wright mee a Line by the post the first oportuneaty
and he Will Lodge it at Mr. John
Miler son hinkston fork as I wish to know
Where and When it is to be Laat [let] So
that I may atend at the time</p>

<p class="center">I am Deer Sir your very omble sarvent&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_29_30" id="FNanchor_29_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_30" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Boone probably did not get the contract.<a name="FNanchor_30_31" id="FNanchor_30_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_31" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>In 1797 five hundred pounds were appropriated
for the repair of the road and
erection of toll-gates. The result of this
and all subsequent legislation, to preserve
a thoroughfare after its day and reason for
existence had passed, is thus summed up
by Mr. Allen: &ldquo;But despite all this&mdash;despite
all that has been done to civilize it
since Boone traced its course in 1790 [1775?],
this honored historic thoroughfare remains
today as it was in the beginning, with all
its sloughs and sands, its mud and holes,
and jutting ledges of rock and loose bowlders,
and twists and turns, and general
total depravity.&rdquo; And yet &ldquo;it is impos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>sible,&rdquo;
Mr. Allen continues, &ldquo;to come upon
this road without pausing, or to write of it
without a tribute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mountainous portions of Boone&rsquo;s old
road are the picturesque as well as the
historic portions. And come what may,
this zig-zag pathway through Powell&rsquo;s
Valley and Cumberland Gap can never be
effaced&mdash;never forgotten. The footsteps
of the tens of thousands who have passed
over it, exhausted though each pilgrim may
have been, have left a trace that a thousand
years cannot eradicate. And so long
as the print of those weary feet can be seen
in dark Powell&rsquo;s Valley, on Cumberland
Gap, and beside Yellow and Rockcastle
Creeks, so long will there be a memorial
left to perpetuate the heroism of the first
Kentuckians&mdash;and the memory of what
the Middle West owes to Virginia and her
neighbors. For when all is said this track
from tide water through Cumberland Gap
must remain a monument to the courage
and patriotism of the people of old Virginia
and North Carolina.</p>

<p>Cumberland Gap, &ldquo;that high-swung
gateway through the mountain&rdquo; stands as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
&ldquo;a landmark of what Nature can do when
she wishes to give an opportunity to the
human race in its migrations and discoveries,
without surrendering control of its
liberty and its fate.&rdquo; Here passed the
mound-building Indian and the buffalo,
marking the first routes from North to South
across the continent. Here later passed
the first flood-tide of white men&rsquo;s immigration.
There are few spots on the continent,
it is said, where the traveler of today
is brought more quickly to a pause, overcome
equally by the stupendous panorama
before him, and by the memory of the
historical associations which will assail
even the most indifferent. Ere you reach
the Gap &ldquo;the idea of it,&rdquo; writes Mr. Allen,
&ldquo;dominates the mind. While yet some
miles away, it looms up, 1675 feet in
elevation, some half a mile across from
crest to crest, the pinnacle on the left
towering to the height of 2500 feet. It
was late in the afternoon when our tired
horses began the long, winding, rocky
climb from the valley to the brow of the
pass. As we stood in the passway, amid
the deepening shadows of the twilight and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
the solemn repose of the mighty landscape,
the Gap seemed to be crowded with two
invisible and countless pageants of human
life, the one passing in, the other passing
out; and the air grew thick with unheard
utterances&mdash;primeval sounds undistinguishable
and strange, of creatures nameless
and never seen by man; the wild rush
and whoop of retreating and pursuing
tribes; the slow steps of watchful pioneers;
the wail of dying children and the songs
of homeless women; the muffled tread of
routed and broken armies&mdash;all the sounds
of surprise and delight, victory and defeat,
hunger and pain, and weariness and
despair, that the human heart can utter.
Here passed the first of the white race who
led the way into the valley of the Cumberland;
here passed that small band of fearless
men who gave the Gap its name; here
passed the &lsquo;Long Hunters&rsquo;; here rushed
armies of the Civil War; here has passed
the wave of westerly immigration, whose
force has spent itself only on the Pacific
slopes; and here in the long future must
flow backward and forward the wealth of
the North and the South.&rdquo;</p>
